## Summary Statistics  
This tab provides some descriptions of the population being examined
after the genetic value analysis has been run. 
The tab reports the number of known founders, female founders, male founders,
founder equivalents, and founder genome equivalents with the first table, 
which has a single row.
The second table has a row for Mean Kinship and a row for Genome Uniqueness.
Each row has the Tukey five number summary, which is the minimum, 1^st^
quartile, mean, median, 3^rd^ quartile, and maximum. 
Lastly, the tab displays histograms and box plots of the distribution of
mean kinship coefficients, the distribution of mean kinship coefficient 
Z-scores, Distribution of genome uniqueness values.
