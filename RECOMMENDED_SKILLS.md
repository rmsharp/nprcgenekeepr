# Recommended Skills

This file is the canonical index of Claude Code skills the methodology
recommends. The recommendation is **citation**, not dependency: each
entry names a skill that implements a discipline the methodology calls
for at a specific phase or workstream. The methodology’s rules remain
the operative guidance when a skill is unavailable; the skill is a
sharper instrument when present.

**Principle (from
[`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`](https://github.com/rmsharp/nprcgenekeepr/docs/methodology/ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.html#recommended-skills)
§Recommended Skills):** *Methodology recommends; methodology does not
reimplement.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How this index is used

- **From inside methodology docs.** Phase descriptions, workstreams, and
  `SESSION_RUNNER.md` cite skills by slash-command name (`/verify`,
  `/grill-me`) at the point of recommendation. They do not re-describe
  what the skill does.
- **From inside an adopting project.** The project’s `CLAUDE.md` (per
  `starter-kit/CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`) and `BOOTSTRAP.md` procedures may
  pin specific skills as part of project setup. Adopters use this index
  to decide which skills to install.
- **As a pinning layer.** External skills change. Each external entry
  lists a **known-good commit SHA** (captured when methodology verified
  the skill). Adopters who want supply-chain stability should fork the
  skill at that SHA rather than tracking upstream `main`.

**Verification date for this index:** 2026-05-25.

## Skills from Matt Pocock’s repository

**Source:**
[`github.com/mattpocock/skills`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) —
community-maintained skill library.

**Stability note.** Pocock’s repo is community-maintained; the
methodology has no control over its lifecycle. Each entry below pins a
known-good commit SHA. **For production reliance, fork the skill** at
that SHA into a repo under your control, or vendor it as a Claude Code
plugin you administer. The pin protects against upstream API churn; the
fork protects against deletion.

## Skills from Claude Code (built-in or installable)

**Source:** Anthropic’s Claude Code. Skill availability varies by Claude
Code version and environment; cross-check against [Anthropic’s Claude
Code documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) for the
current authoritative list.

**Stability note.** Claude Code skills are maintained by Anthropic.
Fork-for-stability is not the typical posture; tracking the official
skill is appropriate. If a skill listed here disappears or is renamed in
a future Claude Code release, treat that as a signal to update the
methodology’s citation, not as a reason to fork.

| Skill | Where methodology recommends it |
|----|----|
| `/verify` | [`SESSION_RUNNER.md`](https://github.com/rmsharp/nprcgenekeepr/SESSION_RUNNER.md) §Phase 3E Runtime Smoke Test — recommended procedure for runtime verification |
| `/run` | [`SESSION_RUNNER.md`](https://github.com/rmsharp/nprcgenekeepr/SESSION_RUNNER.md) §Phase 3E — companion to `/verify`; [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](https://github.com/rmsharp/methodology/blob/main/starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md) — runtime drive guidance |
| `/init` | [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](https://github.com/rmsharp/methodology/blob/main/starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md) Step 4 — initializing `CLAUDE.md` |

## When a recommended skill is unavailable

The methodology’s text remains the operative guidance. The skill is a
sharper instrument; the underlying discipline does not depend on it.
Examples:

- **`/verify` unavailable.** Phase 3E’s rule — “launch the application
  before committing and verify the behavior” — applies. The agent runs
  the verification manually.
- **`/grill-me` unavailable.** Phase 2.5’s procedure (list decisions,
  draft recommendations, present one at a time) applies. The session
  runs the grill manually.
- **`/git-guardrails-claude-code` unavailable.** SAFEGUARDS’ “Blast
  Radius Limits” table applies as textual discipline. Without the hook
  there is no mechanical block; the rules still bind.

Adopters who routinely operate without these skills are operating the
methodology as it was originally written. The recommendation makes the
methodology sharper; it does not make the unrecommended version broken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Future-audit candidates

The methodology has additional content that could benefit from skill
citations but was not in scope for the release that introduced this
index. Flagged for follow-on workstream sessions:

- **`AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` Medium/Heavy pass.** Beyond the Light citation
  insertions shipped with this index, the workstream’s per-phase audit
  framing and the 7-Dimension Audit Framework could be re-examined for
  skill-citation opportunities.
- **`workstreams/RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md`.** The Render
  Verification section and v2.5 anti-pattern \#20 (Silent
  render-dependency fallback) could cite `/verify` for the post-render
  check.
- **`SESSION_RUNNER.md` FM countermeasures.** Several text rules in the
  Known Failure Modes table could be converted to Claude Code hooks (per
  the audit doc’s Observation 3). When that conversion work happens, the
  FM table gains a “Mechanical enforcement” column citing the hook.
- **`workstreams/DEVELOPMENT_WORKSTREAM.md`.** Beyond Issue Lifecycle,
  the existing content can be audited for further skill-citation
  opportunities.
