# Iterative Session Methodology

A framework for producing high-quality software through structured, self-correcting AI agent sessions. Each session follows a fixed phase sequence, accumulates knowledge, and feeds lessons back into the process. The result: sessions compound — session 40 is dramatically better than session 10, using the same tools on the same type of work.

## The Problem

AI agents are capable but inconsistent. They skip steps, lose context between sessions, start implementing before researching, and treat speed as evidence of quality. A methodology document alone doesn't fix this — agents read it, understand it conceptually, and still skip steps. Understanding a concept and following a procedure are fundamentally different cognitive tasks.

This framework solves the problem with three layers:

| Layer | Document | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Cockpit checklist** | `SESSION_RUNNER.md` | Step-by-step procedure. Follow this. |
| **Flight manual** | `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` | Theory and principles. Reference this. |
| **Mission procedures** | `workstreams/*_WORKSTREAM.md` | Domain-specific adaptations. Execute these. |
| **Campaign templates** | `workstreams/*_CAMPAIGN.md` | Multi-session campaign sequences extending a workstream. |

The checklist constrains. The manual teaches. The mission procedures specialize. Campaign templates sequence sessions across a multi-session deliverable. All four are needed.

## Evidence

Extracted from an initial 11-session UI/UX design series. Validated across 1100+ sessions spanning implementation, CI integration, plugin architecture, code review, planning, and audit work.

| Metric | Session 1 | Session 10 | Session 40+ |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Iterations to approval | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| Stakeholder corrections | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Defects found in existing work | 0 | 15 | 15+ |
| Patterns in library | 5 | 40+ | Stable |

**What changed was not skill — it was methodology.** The same agent, same tools, same problem type, radically different outcomes.

## The 9 Principles

| # | Principle | One-Line Summary |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Complete-Then-Create** | Finish ALL research before ANY creative work |
| 2 | **Self-Correcting Loop** | Every failure becomes a numbered anti-pattern. The process evolves. |
| 3 | **Hard Phase Gates** | You cannot skip phases. Gates are structural, not advisory. |
| 4 | **Knowledge Compounding** | Later sessions build on earlier sessions by citation, not re-derivation |
| 5 | **Honest Accounting** | What Went Right AND What Went Wrong, tracked quantitatively |
| 6 | **Scope Validation** | "Am I solving the right problem?" before "Am I solving the problem right?" |
| 7 | **Ascending Verification** | Move from assumptions to mechanical checks as trust increases |
| 8 | **Handoff Accountability** | Evaluate the previous session's handoff. Write yours knowing you'll be evaluated. |
| 9 | **Session Scope Bounding** | One deliverable per session. When it's done, close out. |

Principle 8 is the most important discovery. The bidirectional accountability loop — knowing the next session will score your handoff, having scored your predecessor's — is what makes sessions compound rather than stay isolated.

## The 6 Phases

```
Pre-Flight → Research → Create → Present → Implement → Verify & Close
```

Each phase is gated. You cannot enter the next phase until the current one is complete. The most valuable gate is between Present and Implement: no implementation begins without stakeholder approval.

## Quick Start
*NOTE: The absolute fastest way to use this is to tell Claude (or other service), "Use this methodology: https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology". Claude will pull it down and put it in place for you. To update an existing project to the latest version, use the same approach: "Update methodology using https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology".*

> **Important:** After setup completes, start a **new session** before giving Claude real work. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` at session start — changes made during setup don't take effect until the next session. If you say "go" in the same session, Claude will work without the protocol.

### 1. Copy files to your project

**Option A — scripted (recommended if you have a local methodology checkout):**

```bash
../methodology/bin/sync your-project/             # committed mode (default)
../methodology/bin/sync your-project/ --mode=ignore  # or: multi-project operator mode
../methodology/bin/sync your-project/ --source=github  # or: pull from GitHub (needs gh CLI)
```

This copies `SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `SAFEGUARDS.md`, and `methodology_dashboard.py` into the target. See [`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md`](starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md) for the difference between committed and ignored modes.

**Option B — manual:**

Copy `starter-kit/SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `starter-kit/SAFEGUARDS.md`, `starter-kit/SESSION_NOTES.md`, `starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md`, and `starter-kit/ROADMAP.md` to your project root. Copy the framework files (`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`, `HOW_TO_USE.md`, `workstreams/`) to `docs/methodology/`.

### 2. Tell Claude to use it

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code reads this file at the start of every session):

```markdown
## SESSION PROTOCOL — FOLLOW BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

Read and follow `SESSION_RUNNER.md` step by step. It is your operating procedure
for every session. It tells you what to read, when to stop, and how to close out.
```

**That's it.** Claude will orient, wait for your task, execute one deliverable, and auto-close with handoff notes for the next session. Everything cascades from that one instruction — `SESSION_RUNNER.md` tells Claude to read `SAFEGUARDS.md` and `SESSION_NOTES.md`, which establish commit discipline and session continuity.

### 3. Set up task tracking

Create a `BACKLOG.md` at your project root with your current tasks and priorities — open work items only. Copy `starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md` and `starter-kit/ROADMAP.md` to your project root for completed work history and feature inventory. This three-file split keeps BACKLOG.md scannable (agents read it at session start) while preserving history in dedicated files. When you complete work, remove it from `BACKLOG.md` and add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`. See **[`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md`](starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md)** for migration steps if you have an existing monolithic BACKLOG.md.

### Full setup guide

See **[`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md`](starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md)** for the complete step-by-step guide including customization, first session checklist, and troubleshooting.

### What's in the starter kit

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | Complete setup guide, customization, troubleshooting |
| `SESSION_RUNNER.md` | Cockpit checklist template (no project-specific history) |
| `SESSION_NOTES.md` | Empty template for session continuity |
| `SAFEGUARDS.md` | Safety rails: commit discipline, blast radius limits, mode switching |
| `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md` | Template for project `CLAUDE.md` with SESSION PROTOCOL block and Adaptations section |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Completed work history template — keeps BACKLOG.md lean |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Feature inventory and future plans template |
| `methodology_dashboard.py` | Health scanner: project scoring, risk assessment, compliance dashboard |

### Methodology Dashboard

`tools/methodology_dashboard.py` is a portfolio health scanner that turns methodology compliance into a visible, measurable signal.

**Two modes, auto-detected:**
- **Portfolio mode** — place the script in the parent directory above your repos. It discovers all sibling git repositories and scores them as a portfolio.
- **Single-project mode** — place the script inside a git repo. It scores that project and also discovers git submodules as separate entries.

**What it does:**
- **Discovers** git repositories automatically (sibling repos or submodules depending on mode)
- **Collects** metrics across 7 dimensions: git activity, file structure, tests, CI/CD, documentation, methodology compliance, dependencies
- **Scores** each project's health (0-100) across 5 weighted dimensions (activity, testing, documentation, CI/CD, methodology)
- **Assesses** risk with severity-tagged flags (critical/high/medium/low) for issues like abandonment, missing tests, no CI, large files, low velocity
- **Generates** a self-contained HTML dashboard with collapsible project cards, sortable by health/risk/name/activity
- **Prints** a color-coded terminal summary for quick at-a-glance status

**Live dashboard:** The generated HTML auto-refreshes every 60 seconds. Run the script once, open `dashboard.html` in your browser, and leave it open — it stays current as you work. Re-run the script whenever you want updated data.

Requires only Python 3 (stdlib, no dependencies). Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

#### Dashboard Overview

Portfolio health score, risk matrix, methodology compliance table, commit activity chart, and sortable project cards — all in a single self-contained HTML file.

## Key Concepts

### The Session Runner

The methodology framework describes WHAT to do and WHY. In practice, it needs an operational wrapper — a cockpit checklist — that ensures the phases are actually followed. The Session Runner provides:

- **Mandatory orientation** — prevents starting work without understanding current state
- **"1 and done" rule** — prevents scope creep and quality degradation
- **Automatic close-out** — prevents skipping the self-improvement loop
- **23 known failure modes** — documents agent tendencies with specific countermeasures
- **Degradation detection** — 7 warning signs that predict protocol erosion
- **Handoff accountability** — ensures each session sets up the next for success

### The Handoff Accountability Loop

Every session close-out includes two steps:

1. **Evaluate the previous session's handoff** — Score it 1-10. What helped? What was missing? What was wrong?
2. **Write your own handoff knowing the next session will score it** — Include key files, line numbers, gotchas, and traps.

This creates accountability that transforms handoff quality. Before this pattern: perfunctory notes. After: detailed, accurate, actionable handoffs with gotchas that catch real issues.

### Workstreams

Domain-specific adaptations of the master framework. Each workstream customizes the Research, Create, and Verify phases for its domain:

| Workstream | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **Design** | UI layouts, component arrangements, visual hierarchy |
| **Architecture** | Systems, APIs, data models, integration patterns |
| **Development** | Feature implementation, bug fix campaigns |
| **Audit** | Code reviews, security assessments, quality gates |
| **Research Documentation** | Research papers, technical reports, dissertations, regulatory analyses |

**Campaigns** (multi-session work patterns with reusable templates) extend a workstream when a deliverable cannot be produced in one session even after correct decomposition. Campaign templates live in `workstreams/` under the `*_CAMPAIGN.md` naming convention. See [`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` §Multi-Session Campaigns](ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md#multi-session-campaigns) and the realized example [`workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md`](workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md).

### When to Use / When Not to Use

**Use when:**
- You do the same TYPE of work repeatedly
- Quality matters more than speed on any individual session
- You want each session to be better than the last

**Don't use when:**
- One-off tasks with no repetition (the loop has nothing to feed into)
- Trivial tasks where the overhead exceeds the work
- Exploratory work with no defined deliverable

## Origin

Developed by Terrell Deppe (KJ5HST) using Claude Code (Anthropic) during development of a commercial software product. The methodology emerged organically from an initial 11-session design series, was codified into a reusable framework, and subsequently validated across 1100+ sessions of varied work.

The framework is agent-independent — it works with any AI coding agent that supports persistent files and session-based interaction. It also works for human developers, though the Session Runner and known failure modes are specifically tuned for AI agent tendencies.

### What's New in v2.6

> **Methodology recommends; methodology does not reimplement.**

- **Skill-recommendation convention** — new content layer alongside phases, principles, workstreams, and campaigns. If a discipline can be expressed as a Claude Code skill (built-in like `/verify`, `/code-review`; community like Pocock's `/grill-me`, `/diagnose`), methodology cites the skill at the relevant phase or workstream instead of re-documenting the discipline in its own voice. Methodology owns *what to do and when*; skills own *how to do it*.
- **New `starter-kit/RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`** — canonical index of recommended skills with two tables (Pocock community skills + Claude Code built-ins). External entries include per-skill known-good commit SHAs for adopters who want to pin a verified version; Pocock entries carry a "fork for production reliance" note.
- **New `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` §Recommended Skills** — short principle paragraph + pointer to the index. Inline citations in workstreams and `SESSION_RUNNER.md` reference skills by slash-command name without re-describing them.
- **Conceptual content distilled from a 16-skill audit** (`docs/audits/2026-05-02-mattpocock-skills-evaluation.md`):
  - **FM #25 — Horizontal slicing** appended to `SESSION_RUNNER.md` (FMs 1–24 unchanged).
  - **Phase 3F / Phase 6 step 8** gain an explicit "remove debug instrumentation before commit" gate, citing `/diagnose` for the tagged-debug-log convention.
  - **New `starter-kit/CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`** — project-level domain-glossary template; **Phase 2 Research gains a new step 1** ("read CONTEXT.md if present"), citing `/grill-with-docs` for maintenance.
  - **New Issue Lifecycle section in `DEVELOPMENT_WORKSTREAM.md`** — 5-state machine (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) with transition rules, citing `/triage` for the workflow.
  - **New `Debugging Sessions` session type in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`** — naming + recognition only; cites `/diagnose` for the workflow.
  - **New Refactor Heuristics section in `ARCHITECTURE_WORKSTREAM.md`** — deepening + deletion-test heuristics from Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design*, citing `/improve-codebase-architecture` for the worked-session shape.
  - **New optional Phase 2.5 (Pre-Create Grill) in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`** + matching `SESSION_RUNNER.md` task-mapping row; cites `/grill-me` for the grill workflow.
  - **`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md` Step 10** gains a tool-agnostic pre-commit hooks paragraph (cites `/setup-pre-commit` as one option) plus a mechanical-SAFEGUARDS-enforcement pointer to `/git-guardrails-claude-code`.
- **Refactor of existing content under the principle:**
  - `SESSION_RUNNER.md` §Phase 3E Runtime Smoke Test body shortened to a rule + citation of `/verify` and `/run`; intent preserved (the runtime-verify gate stays).
  - `AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` Light citation pass — new "Recommended Skills" callout cites `/code-review`, `/review`, `/security-review`. The 7-Dimension Audit Framework and per-phase audit framing stay as methodology-owned content.
- **Future-audit candidates flagged in release** (out of scope this release):
  - `AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` Medium/Heavy pass — per-phase citation audit beyond Light.
  - `RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md` — render-verification could cite `/verify`.
  - `SESSION_RUNNER.md` FM mechanical-enforcement column — depends on hook-conversion design.
  - `DEVELOPMENT_WORKSTREAM.md` citation audit beyond Issue Lifecycle.
- **Backward compatible.** No principle, phase, or quality-gate change. FM #25 appended (FMs 1–24 unchanged). Phase 2 step renumbered 1→2..7→8; the Phase 2 cross-references in `HOW_TO_USE.md` all cite by name, never by step number, so the renumber is safe. Adopters who never use the recommended skills continue to operate the methodology as written; the citations are recommendations, not hard dependencies.

### What's New in v2.5

- **Render-dependency completeness discipline** — closes the gap where rendering succeeds while the output silently uses fallback assets instead of the ones configured. Universal principle lands in `SAFEGUARDS.md` (new "Verify Render-Dependency Completeness" sub-section under "Verify the Build Equivalent"); concrete toolchain commands land in `RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md`. Resolves upstream issue [#12](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/12).
- **Two-tier check, by trigger:**
  - **Post-render** (e.g., `pdffonts` confirming all configured font faces actually embedded) — hard rule, part of the build-equivalent step, blocks commit on failure.
  - **Pre-render / setup** (e.g., `fc-list "<family>"` returning the expected face count; `kpsewhich` resolving per-face files) — soft prompt at Phase 0 when render-dep configuration changes.
- **Toolchain matrix gains a "Render-Dep Check" column** — per-toolchain canonical commands for Quarto, LaTeX, Sphinx, Pandoc, AsciiDoc, and (n/a) vanilla Markdown, listing static and post-render commands side-by-side.
- **New research-doc anti-pattern #20: Silent render-dependency fallback** — derived from the joy/ project's SBL BibLit case (Regular-only font, italic markup rendered as upright Latin glyphs for 47 sessions before being noticed visually). Mitigation cross-references the new toolchain column and SAFEGUARDS sub-section.
- **`RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md` updated** — Render Verification section in the creation-mode REPORT.md template gains a render-dep completeness line so the campaign inherits the discipline.
- **Backward compatible** — no principle, phase, gate, or workstream changes; no FM renumbering; existing adopters absorb the new SAFEGUARDS sub-section via `bin/sync`. Domain-specific commands live in the research-doc workstream and only affect projects that use it.

### What's New in v2.4

- **Multi-session campaigns promoted to first-class layer** — campaign templates are now an explicit layer in the document hierarchy alongside workstreams. New section in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` (`§Multi-Session Campaigns`); new orientation step in `SESSION_RUNNER.md` (Phase 1 multi-session campaign check); new `workstreams/TEMPLATE_CAMPAIGN.md` skeleton.
- **Realized examples:**
  - `workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md` — extends the Research Documentation workstream for exhaustive primary-source verification; decomposes the work into a planning → execution → consolidation campaign. Supports creation and audit modes.
  - `workstreams/INHERITED_CODEBASE_FAMILIARIZATION_CAMPAIGN.md` — extends the Audit workstream for taking over an unfamiliar codebase; feeds the Development workstream via a prioritized backlog. Supports interview mode (departing owner available) and archaeology mode (owner gone).
- **No new principles, phases, gates, or workstreams.** The change is structural-vocabulary only: it names the campaign layer that already exists in practice and gives it a documented home.

### What's New in v2.3

Combined release covering two contributions: a new Research Documentation workstream and a SESSION_RUNNER content release distilled from a 90-session field audit of `rad-con/SESSION_RUNNER.md` (issue #6 → audit doc → issue #7). FMs 1–23 are unchanged — no canonical renumbering.

**Research Documentation workstream**

- **New `workstreams/RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md`** — adapts the methodology for research papers, technical reports, dissertations, and regulatory analyses
- **Source-corpus management procedures** — pre-flag completeness audit, WAF retrieval hierarchy, filename verification, post-hoc dedup
- **Claim-source audit pattern** — every numeric, dated, or attributed claim requires a ≤40-word quoted passage from a primary source; baseline ~22% unsupported / ~12% re-attribution rate from real-world use
- **19 documented anti-patterns** specific to research documentation, including citation drift, filename trust, premature delete on audit-flagged claims, and goal-language for constraints
- **Toolchain adaptation table** — Quarto, LaTeX, Sphinx, Pandoc, AsciiDoc, and Markdown equivalents for citation checking, render commands, cross-reference verification, and figure scripts
- **Audit Mode** — adapts the workstream's machinery for fresh-eyes review of existing research repositories; uses the `AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` review-session pattern with this workstream's verification checklist as audit criteria, the 19 anti-patterns as finding categories, and the claim-source map as an audit sampling instrument

**SESSION_RUNNER content release**

- **New Phase 3E: Runtime Smoke Test** — if a deliverable changes runtime behavior (startup config, service registration, plugin loading, dispatch, integration wiring), launch the application and verify before committing. "Build clean" is necessary but not sufficient. Phase numbering shifts: old 3E (Commit) → 3F, old 3F (Report and STOP) → 3G.
- **New Failure Mode #24: Build-passes-ship-it** — appended (not inserted), so existing FM numbers 1–23 are unchanged. Catches sessions that treat `mvn clean package` / `npm run build` success as runtime correctness when the deliverable is integration behavior.
- **Phase 1B framing** — added "structural control, not a suggestion" line. Mandatory close-out steps are how clean-delivery streaks don't collapse.
- **Planning Sessions anecdote** — concrete cost of skipping evidence-based inventory: a planning session missed 10+ scattered references because it never ran grep; two greps would have found them all.
- **5 new Learnings rows:**
  - #2 — Protocol discipline is perishable (14 clean sessions can collapse to 1/10 in 12 hours)
  - #3 — Plans should flag "here be dragons" areas
  - #4 — Verify plan output against completion criteria, not session duration (refined from community feedback to remove "collapse multi-session work into a single session" framing — that phrasing read as license to bend "1 and done")
  - #5 — Code review is a distinct deliverable; produce actionable plans, not vague critique
  - #6 — A plan written from memory of a file read is an assumption-level claim
- **Backward compatible.** No FM renumbering. Phase rename only affects sessions or memories that cite "Phase 3E Commit" by number — adopters should grep their memory + project notes for that string and update to "Phase 3F Commit."

### What's New in v2.2

- **`bin/sync` tool** — dual-mode (`--mode=commit` / `--mode=ignore`) and dual-source (`--source=local` / `--source=github`) sync for starter-kit files. Committed mode is the existing pattern; ignored mode is new, for multi-project operators who want methodology updates to propagate via one command from a sibling `methodology/` checkout.
- **`bin/status` tool** — drift reporter across one or many projects. Shows `current`, `N versions behind`, `locally modified`, or `missing` per synced file.
- **Drift safety** — `bin/sync` refuses to overwrite files with local modifications (not matching canonical or any historical version). Pass `--force` to override, or move customizations to CLAUDE.md's Adaptations section first.
- **`starter-kit/CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`** — new template for project `CLAUDE.md` files, including the **Project-Specific Methodology Adaptations** section. This is the canonical seam for per-project customizations (task mappings, Phase 0 steps, project Learnings, project failure modes) — keeping synced files byte-identical to canonical.
- **BOOTSTRAP.md rewrite** — documents committed vs ignored modes, the customization seam pattern, and the updating workflow (`bin/status` → `bin/sync`).
- **Backward compatible** — existing adopters on v2.1 who copy files manually continue to work unchanged. The scripted workflow is additive.

### What's New in v2.1

- **CHANGELOG.md and ROADMAP.md templates** — new starter-kit files that split task tracking into three focused files: BACKLOG.md (open work only), CHANGELOG.md (completed work history), ROADMAP.md (feature inventory and future plans)
- **Migration guide** — step-by-step instructions in BOOTSTRAP.md for projects with an existing monolithic BACKLOG.md
- **4 new failure modes** (#20-23): edit from memory, greenfield assumption, overwrite user edits, question-as-instruction
- **Artifact Integrity section** in SAFEGUARDS.md — read before edit, preserve user edits, verify the build equivalent
- **Build equivalent step** — new Step 6 in BOOTSTRAP.md for identifying and recording the project's verification command
- **Documentation project adaptations** — adaptation table and anti-patterns in TEMPLATE_WORKSTREAM.md, expanded audit scope in AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md
- **Dashboard compliance updated** — methodology dashboard now checks for CHANGELOG.md and ROADMAP.md presence (6 → 8 required items)
- **Consistent references** — SAFEGUARDS.md, SESSION_RUNNER.md, and README updated to reference the three-file approach

### What's New in v2.0

- **Methodology Dashboard** — new portfolio health scanner (`tools/methodology_dashboard.py`) that scores projects on 5 dimensions (activity, testing, documentation, CI/CD, methodology compliance) and generates a self-contained HTML dashboard
- **Two scanning modes** — portfolio mode (scans sibling git repos) and single-project mode (scans the project + git submodules), auto-detected based on placement
- **Health scoring (0-100)** with 5 weighted dimensions and rule-based risk assessment (critical/high/medium/low flags)
- **Methodology compliance scoring (0-100)** — weighted checklist of required methodology items (SESSION_RUNNER, SAFEGUARDS, SESSION_NOTES, BACKLOG, docs/methodology/, workstreams/)
- **Color-coded terminal output** — at-a-glance status without opening the browser
- **Live HTML dashboard** — auto-refreshes every 60 seconds; collapsible project cards sortable by health, risk, name, or activity
- **Starter kit includes dashboard** — `starter-kit/methodology_dashboard.py` for per-project use
- **Zero dependencies** — Python 3 stdlib only, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### What's New in v1.2

- **Planning session discipline** — plans are deliverables, not preambles. A planning session closes out after the plan; implementation is a separate session.
- **Evidence-based inventory** — plans that involve deletion, migration, or renaming must include grep-based inventories of all affected symbols. No more assumption-based file lists.
- **Per-phase completion criteria** — every phase in a multi-phase plan must state what DONE looks like, verification commands, and an explicit session boundary.
- **Plan-mode exit trap** — explicit warning that Plan Mode's "Implement the following plan" preamble does NOT mean start coding. The plan is a draft until evidence-verified.
- **2 new failure modes** (#18-19): planning-to-implementation bleed, plan-mode bypass
- **2 new degradation detection signs** for planning discipline violations
- **Planning Session Checklist** — 5-item verification before closing a planning session
- **Learnings table** added to Session Runner — institutional memory that grows with each session

### What's New in v1.1

- **Protocol Erosion section** — documents how methodology discipline degrades over time and how to detect it early
- **Phase 1.5: Claim the Session** — write a stub before starting work so even crashed sessions leave a trace
- **Minimum Handoff Requirements** — 6 mandatory items with bad/good examples; "pick next from backlog" is explicitly called out as insufficient
- **Ghost session detection** — Phase 0 now checks for undocumented sessions between the last notes and current state
- **Fabrication warning** — honest accounting now explicitly addresses false credit and fabricated quotes
- **4 new failure modes** (#14-17): ghost sessions, minimal handoffs, fabrication, protocol erosion
- **Degradation Detection table** — 7 warning signs with responses
- **Quality Gates expanded** from 10 to 12
