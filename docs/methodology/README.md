# Iterative Session Methodology

A framework for producing high-quality software through structured, self-correcting AI agent sessions. Each session follows a fixed phase sequence, accumulates knowledge, and feeds lessons back into the process. The result: sessions compound — session 40 is dramatically better than session 10, using the same tools on the same type of work.

## The Problem

AI agents are capable but inconsistent. They skip steps, lose context between sessions, start implementing before researching, and treat speed as evidence of quality. A methodology document alone doesn't fix this — agents read it, understand it conceptually, and still skip steps. Understanding a concept and following a procedure are fundamentally different cognitive tasks.

This framework solves the problem with three layers:

| Layer | Document | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Cockpit checklist** | `SESSION_RUNNER.md` | Step-by-step procedure. Follow this. |
| **Flight manual** | `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` | Theory and principles. Reference this. |
| **Mission procedures** | `workstreams/*.md` | Domain-specific adaptations. Execute these. |

The checklist constrains. The manual teaches. The mission procedures specialize. All three are needed.

## Evidence

Extracted from an 11-session UI/UX design series. Validated across 60+ sessions spanning implementation, CI integration, plugin architecture, code review, planning, and audit work.

| Metric | Session 1 | Session 10 | Session 40+ |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Iterations to approval | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| Stakeholder corrections | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Defects found in existing work | 0 | 15 | 15+ |
| Patterns in library | 5 | 40+ | Stable |

**What changed was not skill — it was methodology.** The same agent, same tools, same problem type, radically different outcomes.

## The 9 Principles

| # | Principle | One-Line Summary |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Complete-Then-Create** | Finish ALL research before ANY creative work |
| 2 | **Self-Correcting Loop** | Every failure becomes a numbered anti-pattern. The process evolves. |
| 3 | **Hard Phase Gates** | You cannot skip phases. Gates are structural, not advisory. |
| 4 | **Knowledge Compounding** | Later sessions build on earlier sessions by citation, not re-derivation |
| 5 | **Honest Accounting** | What Went Right AND What Went Wrong, tracked quantitatively |
| 6 | **Scope Validation** | "Am I solving the right problem?" before "Am I solving the problem right?" |
| 7 | **Ascending Verification** | Move from assumptions to mechanical checks as trust increases |
| 8 | **Handoff Accountability** | Evaluate the previous session's handoff. Write yours knowing you'll be evaluated. |
| 9 | **Session Scope Bounding** | One deliverable per session. When it's done, close out. |

Principle 8 is the most important discovery. The bidirectional accountability loop — knowing the next session will score your handoff, having scored your predecessor's — is what makes sessions compound rather than stay isolated.

## The 6 Phases

```
Pre-Flight → Research → Create → Present → Implement → Verify & Close
```

Each phase is gated. You cannot enter the next phase until the current one is complete. The most valuable gate is between Present and Implement: no implementation begins without stakeholder approval.

## Quick Start
*NOTE: The absolute fastest way to use this is to tell Claude (or other service), "Use this methodology: https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology". Claude will pull it down and put it in place for you. To update an existing project to the latest version, use the same approach: "Update methodology using https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology".*

> **Important:** After setup completes, start a **new session** before giving Claude real work. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` at session start — changes made during setup don't take effect until the next session. If you say "go" in the same session, Claude will work without the protocol.

### 1. Copy files to your project

Copy `starter-kit/SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `starter-kit/SAFEGUARDS.md`, and `starter-kit/SESSION_NOTES.md` to your project root. Copy the framework files (`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`, `HOW_TO_USE.md`, `workstreams/`) to `docs/methodology/`.

### 2. Tell Claude to use it

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code reads this file at the start of every session):

```markdown
## SESSION PROTOCOL — FOLLOW BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

Read and follow `SESSION_RUNNER.md` step by step. It is your operating procedure
for every session. It tells you what to read, when to stop, and how to close out.
```

**That's it.** Claude will orient, wait for your task, execute one deliverable, and auto-close with handoff notes for the next session. Everything cascades from that one instruction — `SESSION_RUNNER.md` tells Claude to read `SAFEGUARDS.md` and `SESSION_NOTES.md`, which establish commit discipline and session continuity.

### 3. Create a backlog

Create a `BACKLOG.md` at your project root with your current tasks and priorities. The session runner reads this during orientation. You can also tell claude to make a plan for your effort that follows this methodology. Once the plan is created, start a new session and either tell claude to implement the next phase of your plan, and tell it what file the plan is in, or build the backlog from that plan.

### Full setup guide

See **[`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md`](starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md)** for the complete step-by-step guide including customization, first session checklist, and troubleshooting.

### What's in the starter kit

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | Complete setup guide, customization, troubleshooting |
| `SESSION_RUNNER.md` | Cockpit checklist template (no project-specific history) |
| `SESSION_NOTES.md` | Empty template for session continuity |
| `SAFEGUARDS.md` | Safety rails: commit discipline, blast radius limits, mode switching |
| `methodology_dashboard.py` | Health scanner: project scoring, risk assessment, compliance dashboard |

### Methodology Dashboard

`tools/methodology_dashboard.py` is a portfolio health scanner that turns methodology compliance into a visible, measurable signal.

**Two modes, auto-detected:**
- **Portfolio mode** — place the script in the parent directory above your repos. It discovers all sibling git repositories and scores them as a portfolio.
- **Single-project mode** — place the script inside a git repo. It scores that project and also discovers git submodules as separate entries.

**What it does:**
- **Discovers** git repositories automatically (sibling repos or submodules depending on mode)
- **Collects** metrics across 7 dimensions: git activity, file structure, tests, CI/CD, documentation, methodology compliance, dependencies
- **Scores** each project's health (0-100) across 5 weighted dimensions (activity, testing, documentation, CI/CD, methodology)
- **Assesses** risk with severity-tagged flags (critical/high/medium/low) for issues like abandonment, missing tests, no CI, large files, low velocity
- **Generates** a self-contained HTML dashboard with collapsible project cards, sortable by health/risk/name/activity
- **Prints** a color-coded terminal summary for quick at-a-glance status

**Live dashboard:** The generated HTML auto-refreshes every 60 seconds. Run the script once, open `dashboard.html` in your browser, and leave it open — it stays current as you work. Re-run the script whenever you want updated data.

Requires only Python 3 (stdlib, no dependencies). Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Key Concepts

### The Session Runner

The methodology framework describes WHAT to do and WHY. In practice, it needs an operational wrapper — a cockpit checklist — that ensures the phases are actually followed. The Session Runner provides:

- **Mandatory orientation** — prevents starting work without understanding current state
- **"1 and done" rule** — prevents scope creep and quality degradation
- **Automatic close-out** — prevents skipping the self-improvement loop
- **19 known failure modes** — documents agent tendencies with specific countermeasures
- **Degradation detection** — 7 warning signs that predict protocol erosion
- **Handoff accountability** — ensures each session sets up the next for success

### The Handoff Accountability Loop

Every session close-out includes two steps:

1. **Evaluate the previous session's handoff** — Score it 1-10. What helped? What was missing? What was wrong?
2. **Write your own handoff knowing the next session will score it** — Include key files, line numbers, gotchas, and traps.

This creates accountability that transforms handoff quality. Before this pattern: perfunctory notes. After: detailed, accurate, actionable handoffs with gotchas that catch real issues.

### Workstreams

Domain-specific adaptations of the master framework. Each workstream customizes the Research, Create, and Verify phases for its domain:

| Workstream | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **Design** | UI layouts, component arrangements, visual hierarchy |
| **Architecture** | Systems, APIs, data models, integration patterns |
| **Development** | Feature implementation, bug fix campaigns |
| **Audit** | Code reviews, security assessments, quality gates |

### When to Use / When Not to Use

**Use when:**
- You do the same TYPE of work repeatedly
- Quality matters more than speed on any individual session
- You want each session to be better than the last

**Don't use when:**
- One-off tasks with no repetition (the loop has nothing to feed into)
- Trivial tasks where the overhead exceeds the work
- Exploratory work with no defined deliverable

## Origin

Developed by Terrell Deppe (KJ5HST) using Claude Code (Anthropic) during development of a commercial software product. The methodology emerged organically from an 11-session design series, was codified into a reusable framework, and subsequently validated across 60+ sessions of varied work.

The framework is agent-independent — it works with any AI coding agent that supports persistent files and session-based interaction. It also works for human developers, though the Session Runner and known failure modes are specifically tuned for AI agent tendencies.

### What's New in v2.0

- **Methodology Dashboard** — new portfolio health scanner (`tools/methodology_dashboard.py`) that scores projects on 5 dimensions (activity, testing, documentation, CI/CD, methodology compliance) and generates a self-contained HTML dashboard
- **Two scanning modes** — portfolio mode (scans sibling git repos) and single-project mode (scans the project + git submodules), auto-detected based on placement
- **Health scoring (0-100)** with 5 weighted dimensions and rule-based risk assessment (critical/high/medium/low flags)
- **Methodology compliance scoring (0-100)** — weighted checklist of 6 required items (SESSION_RUNNER, SAFEGUARDS, SESSION_NOTES, BACKLOG, docs/methodology/, workstreams/)
- **Color-coded terminal output** — at-a-glance status without opening the browser
- **Live HTML dashboard** — auto-refreshes every 60 seconds; collapsible project cards sortable by health, risk, name, or activity
- **Starter kit includes dashboard** — `starter-kit/methodology_dashboard.py` for per-project use
- **Zero dependencies** — Python 3 stdlib only, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### What's New in v1.2

- **Planning session discipline** — plans are deliverables, not preambles. A planning session closes out after the plan; implementation is a separate session.
- **Evidence-based inventory** — plans that involve deletion, migration, or renaming must include grep-based inventories of all affected symbols. No more assumption-based file lists.
- **Per-phase completion criteria** — every phase in a multi-phase plan must state what DONE looks like, verification commands, and an explicit session boundary.
- **Plan-mode exit trap** — explicit warning that Plan Mode's "Implement the following plan" preamble does NOT mean start coding. The plan is a draft until evidence-verified.
- **2 new failure modes** (#18-19): planning-to-implementation bleed, plan-mode bypass
- **2 new degradation detection signs** for planning discipline violations
- **Planning Session Checklist** — 5-item verification before closing a planning session
- **Learnings table** added to Session Runner — institutional memory that grows with each session

### What's New in v1.1

- **Protocol Erosion section** — documents how methodology discipline degrades over time and how to detect it early
- **Phase 1.5: Claim the Session** — write a stub before starting work so even crashed sessions leave a trace
- **Minimum Handoff Requirements** — 6 mandatory items with bad/good examples; "pick next from backlog" is explicitly called out as insufficient
- **Ghost session detection** — Phase 0 now checks for undocumented sessions between the last notes and current state
- **Fabrication warning** — honest accounting now explicitly addresses false credit and fabricated quotes
- **4 new failure modes** (#14-17): ghost sessions, minimal handoffs, fabrication, protocol erosion
- **Degradation Detection table** — 7 warning signs with responses
- **Quality Gates expanded** from 10 to 12
