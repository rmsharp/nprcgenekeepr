A framework for producing high-quality software through structured, self-correcting AI agent sessions. Each session follows a fixed phase sequence, accumulates knowledge, and feeds lessons back into the process. The result: sessions compound — session 40 is dramatically better than session 10, using the same tools on the same type of work.

## The Problem

AI agents are capable but inconsistent. They skip steps, lose context between sessions, start implementing before researching, and treat speed as evidence of quality. A methodology document alone doesn't fix this — agents read it, understand it conceptually, and still skip steps. Understanding a concept and following a procedure are fundamentally different cognitive tasks.

This framework solves the problem with four layers:

| Layer | Document | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Cockpit checklist** | `SESSION_RUNNER.md` | Step-by-step procedure. Follow this. |
| **Flight manual** | `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` | Theory and principles. Reference this. |
| **Mission procedures** | `workstreams/*_WORKSTREAM.md` | Domain-specific adaptations. Execute these. |
| **Campaign templates** | `workstreams/*_CAMPAIGN.md` | Multi-session campaign sequences extending a workstream. |

The checklist constrains. The manual teaches. The mission procedures specialize. Campaign templates sequence sessions across a multi-session deliverable. All four are needed.

## Evidence

Extracted from an initial 11-session UI/UX design series. Validated across 1100+ sessions spanning implementation, CI integration, plugin architecture, code review, planning, and audit work.

| Metric | Session 1 | Session 10 | Session 40+ |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Iterations to approval | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| Stakeholder corrections | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Defects found in existing work | 0 | 15 | 15+ |
| Patterns in library | 5 | 40+ | Stable |

**What changed was not skill — it was methodology.** The same agent, same tools, same problem type, radically different outcomes.

## The 9 Principles

| # | Principle | One-Line Summary |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Complete-Then-Create** | Finish ALL research before ANY creative work |
| 2 | **Self-Correcting Loop** | Every failure becomes a numbered anti-pattern. The process evolves. |
| 3 | **Hard Phase Gates** | You cannot skip phases. Gates are structural, not advisory. |
| 4 | **Knowledge Compounding** | Later sessions build on earlier sessions by citation, not re-derivation |
| 5 | **Honest Accounting** | What Went Right AND What Went Wrong, tracked quantitatively |
| 6 | **Scope Validation** | "Am I solving the right problem?" before "Am I solving the problem right?" |
| 7 | **Ascending Verification** | Move from assumptions to mechanical checks as trust increases |
| 8 | **Handoff Accountability** | Evaluate the previous session's handoff. Write yours knowing you'll be evaluated. |
| 9 | **Session Scope Bounding** | One deliverable per session. When it's done, close out. |

Principle 8 is the most important discovery. The bidirectional accountability loop — knowing the next session will score your handoff, having scored your predecessor's — is what makes sessions compound rather than stay isolated.

## The 6 Phases

```
Pre-Flight → Research → Create → Present → Implement → Verify & Close
```

Each phase is gated. You cannot enter the next phase until the current one is complete. The most valuable gate is between Present and Implement: no implementation begins without stakeholder approval.

## Quick Start
*NOTE: The absolute fastest way to use this is to tell Claude (or other service), "Use this methodology: https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology". Claude will pull it down and put it in place for you. To update an existing project to the latest version, use the same approach: "Update methodology using https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology".*

> **Important:** After setup completes, start a **new session** before giving Claude real work. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` at session start — changes made during setup don't take effect until the next session. If you say "go" in the same session, Claude will work without the protocol.

### 1. Copy files to your project

**Option A — scripted (recommended if you have a local methodology checkout):**

```bash
../methodology/bin/sync your-project/             # committed mode (default)
../methodology/bin/sync your-project/ --mode=ignore  # or: multi-project operator mode
../methodology/bin/sync your-project/ --source=github  # or: pull from GitHub (needs gh CLI)
```

This copies the full methodology corpus into the target: the operating files (`SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `SAFEGUARDS.md`, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`, `CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`, `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `methodology_dashboard.py`) to the project root, and the framework (`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`, `HOW_TO_USE.md`, `workstreams/`) to `docs/methodology/`. These are kept current on every run. `SESSION_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` are *seeded* at the root only when absent — once they exist they are yours and `bin/sync` never overwrites them. See [`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md`](starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md) for the difference between committed and ignored modes.

**Option B — manual:**

Copy the starter-kit root-files to your project root — `SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `SAFEGUARDS.md`, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`, `CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`, `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `methodology_dashboard.py`, plus `SESSION_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` as starting points you then own. Copy the framework files (`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`, `HOW_TO_USE.md`) and `workstreams/` to `docs/methodology/`. (Option A's `bin/sync` does all of this in one command.)

### 2. Tell Claude to use it

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code reads this file at the start of every session):

```markdown
## SESSION PROTOCOL — FOLLOW BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

Read and follow `SESSION_RUNNER.md` step by step. It is your operating procedure
for every session. It tells you what to read, when to stop, and how to close out.
```

**That's it.** Claude will orient, wait for your task, execute one deliverable, and auto-close with handoff notes for the next session. Everything cascades from that one instruction — `SESSION_RUNNER.md` tells Claude to read `SAFEGUARDS.md` and `SESSION_NOTES.md`, which establish commit discipline and session continuity.

### 3. Set up task tracking

Create a `BACKLOG.md` at your project root with your current tasks and priorities — open work items only. Copy `starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md` and `starter-kit/ROADMAP.md` to your project root for completed work history and feature inventory. This three-file split keeps BACKLOG.md scannable (agents read it at session start) while preserving history in dedicated files. When you complete work, remove it from `BACKLOG.md` and add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`. See **[`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md`](starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md)** for migration steps if you have an existing monolithic BACKLOG.md.

### Full setup guide

See **[`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md`](starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md)** for the complete step-by-step guide including customization, first session checklist, and troubleshooting.

### What's in the starter kit

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | Complete setup guide, customization, troubleshooting |
| `SESSION_RUNNER.md` | Cockpit checklist template (no project-specific history) |
| `SESSION_NOTES.md` | Empty template for session continuity |
| `SAFEGUARDS.md` | Safety rails: commit discipline, blast radius limits, mode switching |
| `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md` | Template for project `CLAUDE.md` with SESSION PROTOCOL block and Adaptations section |
| `CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md` | Project domain-glossary / `CONTEXT.md` template |
| `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` | Index of recommended skills, cited at the relevant phase/workstream |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Completed work history template — keeps BACKLOG.md lean |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Feature inventory and future plans template |
| `methodology_dashboard.py` | Health scanner: project scoring, risk assessment, compliance dashboard |

### Methodology Dashboard

`tools/methodology_dashboard.py` is a portfolio health scanner that turns methodology compliance into a visible, measurable signal.

**Two modes, auto-detected:**
- **Portfolio mode** — place the script in the parent directory above your repos. It discovers all sibling git repositories and scores them as a portfolio.
- **Single-project mode** — place the script inside a git repo. It scores that project and also discovers git submodules as separate entries.

**What it does:**
- **Discovers** git repositories automatically (sibling repos or submodules depending on mode)
- **Collects** metrics across 7 dimensions: git activity, file structure, tests, CI/CD, documentation, methodology compliance, dependencies
- **Scores** each project's health (0-100) across 5 weighted dimensions (activity, testing, documentation, CI/CD, methodology)
- **Assesses** risk with severity-tagged flags (critical/high/medium/low) for issues like abandonment, missing tests, no CI, large files, low velocity
- **Generates** a self-contained HTML dashboard with collapsible project cards, sortable by health/risk/name/activity
- **Prints** a color-coded terminal summary for quick at-a-glance status

**Live dashboard:** The generated HTML auto-refreshes every 60 seconds. Run the script once, open `dashboard.html` in your browser, and leave it open — it stays current as you work. Re-run the script whenever you want updated data.

Requires only Python 3 (stdlib, no dependencies). Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

#### Dashboard Overview

Portfolio health score, risk matrix, methodology compliance table, commit activity chart, and sortable project cards — all in a single self-contained HTML file.

![Dashboard overview showing health score, risk matrix, methodology compliance, and commit activity](docs/images/dashboard-overview.png)

#### Project Detail View

Expand any project card to see health breakdown by dimension, risk factors, git stats, code breakdown by language and category, test metrics, CI/CD status, documentation quality, dependency counts, methodology compliance checklist, and the 10 largest files.

## Tutorials

New to the methodology? The **[tutorials](docs/tutorials/)** are a hands-on, progressive learning track — install the framework, run a real session end to end, and learn where the guardrails catch you. Each lesson has you *do* one thing against a real project (your own repo, or the bundled [sample project](docs/tutorials/sample-project/)), with a checkpoint at every step. The full track — Setup through Keeping Adopters Current (T1–T8) — is published; see the **[series index](docs/tutorials/)** for the full curriculum.

## Key Concepts

### The Session Runner

The methodology framework describes WHAT to do and WHY. In practice, it needs an operational wrapper — a cockpit checklist — that ensures the phases are actually followed. The Session Runner provides:

- **Mandatory orientation** — prevents starting work without understanding current state
- **"1 and done" rule** — prevents scope creep and quality degradation
- **Automatic close-out** — prevents skipping the self-improvement loop
- **27 known failure modes** — documents agent tendencies with specific countermeasures
- **Degradation detection** — 17 warning signs that predict protocol erosion
- **Handoff accountability** — ensures each session sets up the next for success

### The Handoff Accountability Loop

Every session close-out includes two steps:

1. **Evaluate the previous session's handoff** — Score it 1-10. What helped? What was missing? What was wrong?
2. **Write your own handoff knowing the next session will score it** — Include key files, line numbers, gotchas, and traps.

This creates accountability that transforms handoff quality. Before this pattern: perfunctory notes. After: detailed, accurate, actionable handoffs with gotchas that catch real issues.

### Workstreams

Domain-specific adaptations of the master framework. Each workstream customizes the Research, Create, and Verify phases for its domain:

| Workstream | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **Design** | UI layouts, component arrangements, visual hierarchy |
| **Architecture** | Systems, APIs, data models, integration patterns |
| **Development** | Feature implementation, bug fix campaigns |
| **Audit** | Code reviews, security assessments, quality gates |
| **Research Documentation** | Research papers, technical reports, dissertations, regulatory analyses |

**Campaigns** (multi-session work patterns with reusable templates) extend a workstream when a deliverable cannot be produced in one session even after correct decomposition. Campaign templates live in `workstreams/` under the `*_CAMPAIGN.md` naming convention. See [`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` §Multi-Session Campaigns](ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md#multi-session-campaigns) and the realized example [`workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md`](workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md).

### When to Use / When Not to Use

**Use when:**
- You do the same TYPE of work repeatedly
- Quality matters more than speed on any individual session
- You want each session to be better than the last

**Don't use when:**
- One-off tasks with no repetition (the loop has nothing to feed into)
- Trivial tasks where the overhead exceeds the work
- Exploratory work with no defined deliverable

## Origin

Developed by Terrell Deppe (KJ5HST) using Claude Code (Anthropic) during development of a commercial software product. The methodology emerged organically from an initial 11-session design series, was codified into a reusable framework, and subsequently validated across 1100+ sessions of varied work.

The framework is agent-independent — it works with any AI coding agent that supports persistent files and session-based interaction. It also works for human developers, though the Session Runner and known failure modes are specifically tuned for AI agent tendencies.

### What's New in v3.4

Review and audit passes get a **completeness-critic lens** — a review scoped only to the diff misses what the change made stale *elsewhere* in the corpus (rmsharp, [issue #55](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/55)). Motivated by the v3.3 close-out-receipt work: a clean 6-lens adversarial review missed three out-of-diff surfaces (`HOW_TO_USE.md`, the `README.md` tree, and three tutorials) that still described close-out without the new receipt.

- **New Learning #10** — promotes Learning #7 (cross-reference completeness) and Learning #8 (checklist propagation) from an authoring-time self-check to a review-time lens.
- **`AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md`** — new anti-pattern #9 "Diff-scoped blind spot", a new Verification Checklist bullet, and a note that `/code-review`/`/review`/`/security-review` are diff-scoped by design.
- **What to grep** — file/artifact enumerations, worked examples/tutorials, indexes/cross-references, and count/size claims, whenever a change adds, renames, or removes a concept, artifact, file, step, or numbered-set member.
- **No principle, phase, gate, or workstream change; the failure-mode count stays 27.**

### What's New in v3.3

The mandatory **close-out handoff is now a durable, machine-checkable artifact** — closing the one close-out sub-step that left no git-tracked file (rmsharp, [PR #52](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/52)). Previously the handoff lived only in the transient `SESSION_NOTES.md` or the spoken report, so a *skipped* close-out report was invisible until a human noticed. Mirrors v3.1's ledger — **gate-on-write AND reconcile-on-read**.

- **`HANDOFFS.md` receipt** — one machine-checkable ` ```handoff ` block per session (the six Phase 3D handoff fields + both 1–10 scores), seeded to adopters; written `status: pending` at claim, `complete` at close-out.
- **`bin/check-handoff`** (canonical-only) asserts a receipt's presence and structure — never its quality (a green check is not a good handoff).
- **Phase 0 reconcile backstop** — a missing or `pending` receipt is reconstructed `status: reconciled` at the next Orient.
- **Framing** — FM #6 strengthened, a degradation-detection row, new **Learning #9**, and a *recommended* (never shipped) agent-harness stop-hook for the in-session catch.
- **No principle, phase, gate, or workstream change; the failure-mode count stays 27.**

### What's New in v3.2

The **portfolio dashboard now scores document-only / research repositories fairly** instead of penalizing them for having no code to unit-test (rmsharp, [PR #50](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/50)). A doc-only repo previously drew 0/20 Testing and a HIGH "No test infrastructure" risk; now the dashboard detects it and reshapes the scoring. Advisory tool — nothing hard-fails.

- **Doc-only detection** — a bidirectional `.methodology-profile` marker (`doc-only` | `code`) overrides; otherwise a 200 source-LOC cap → a doc-corpus / render-toolchain check. The cap guarantees a mixed code+docs repo is never misclassified.
- **Render/Verification dimension** — when doc-only, the 2nd score slot is filled by an **honest static proxy** for render/verification *configuration* (a render toolchain + the v2.5 `pdffonts`/`fc-list`/`kpsewhich` dependency check + docs-render/link-check CI + verification artifacts); it never claims render *success*. Code-centric test risks are suppressed; the "Large files" flag is fixed to fire only on source files.
- **First functional scoring tests** — `tools/test_methodology_dashboard.py` (29 cases) wired into `bin/tests.sh`; `DASHBOARD_VERSION` → **2.8.0**.
- **No principle, phase, gate, workstream, or failure-mode change; the failure-mode count stays 27.**

### What's New in v3.1

`CHANGELOG.md` becomes a dependable cross-source **action ledger** — the authoritative record of *what was done here, ever* across backlog items, repository issues, and ad-hoc work (rmsharp, [PR #46](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/46)). The design's key finding: a close-out write-gate **alone** is not dependable, so the ledger rests on two mechanisms — **gate-on-write** at close-out *and* **reconcile-on-read** at orientation, which backfills anything the gate missed.

- **New failure mode #27, "Unrecorded action"** (appended; the count moves to **27 failure modes**) — a Phase 3F / Phase 6 close-out step records one dated, source-tagged entry per action (`[issue #<N>]` · `[BL-<N>]` · `[ad hoc]`), newest on top.
- **Reconcile-on-read** — Phase 0 diffs `git log` since the ledger frontier and backfills undocumented commits before new work. The self-healing backstop that makes the ledger true *when you read it*.
- **Tooling** — a dashboard ledger-lag freshness monitor (advisory only; `DASHBOARD_VERSION` → 2.7.0), a `starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md` seed recomposed to the action-ledger shape, and a shipped `.githooks/pre-commit` co-staging hook (bypassable with `--no-verify`; reconcile is the guarantee).
- **6 phases, 12 quality gates, four session types, and every workstream are unchanged** — the additions are FM #27, a Phase 0 reconcile step, and the close-out ledger step (propagated into every session-type and campaign checklist as Learning #8).

### What's New in v3.0

The methodology is now **MIT-licensed** ([#43](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/43), rmsharp). The bespoke source-available `LICENSE` is replaced with the verbatim standard MIT License. The major version bump marks a deliberate change to the *legal terms* — not the content: no principle, phase, gate, workstream, or failure-mode is touched, and the failure-mode count stays 26.

- **What changed legally.** MIT grants the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and **sell** — with attribution (the copyright and permission notice must be retained in copies). The previous license permitted commercial *operational* use but **forbade** selling or productizing the methodology itself; that no-resale restriction is now **intentionally dropped**. Anyone may sell the methodology or derivatives, attribution retained.
- **Why MIT.** It adds the standard `AS IS` warranty/liability disclaimer the bespoke license lacked (reducing the author's residual exposure), removes the interpretive ambiguity around "this methodology *itself*," and is instantly recognizable and GitHub-auto-detected. The trade-off — losing the no-sell guarantee — was weighed against a hardened-custom alternative (which would have closed the same two defects while keeping the restriction) and MIT was chosen by author decision.
- **Lockstep doc updates.** `LICENSE` → verbatim MIT (`Copyright (c) 2025-2026 Terrell Deppe (KJ5HST)`); `README.md` §License and the `CLAUDE.md` license line updated to match, so nothing contradicts the authoritative file.
- **Adopter impact: none mechanical.** `LICENSE` is not a `bin/sync`-distributed file, so installed projects pull no change from this release. If you redistribute or build on the methodology, you are now under MIT terms.

### What's New in v2.9

A combined release of two additive contributions that merged together ([#38](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/38), [#39](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/39), rmsharp): a hands-on **tutorial track** for newcomers, and a **reasoning-effort convention** that generalizes "match effort to the stakes" across the whole framework. No principle, phase, gate, workstream, or failure-mode changes — failure-mode count stays 26.

- **Hands-on tutorial track (#38).** A new [`docs/tutorials/`](docs/tutorials/) learning layer: a progressive, *do-one-thing-per-lesson* curriculum with a checkpoint at every step, run against your own repo or a bundled [sample todo-CLI project](docs/tutorials/sample-project/). The published **core trio** runs Setup (T1) → First Session, with a full worked transcript (T2) → Cautionary Use (T5), alongside a series index and a reusable tutorial template. The sample project intentionally leaves one feature unbuilt so a tutorial session implements it end to end. The tutorials are a **canonical-only learning aid — they are not distributed to adopter projects** by `bin/sync`, so the corpus an installed project receives is unchanged.
- **Reasoning-effort convention (#39).** The guidance to raise an agent's reasoning depth on high-stakes work — previously living only in the Research Documentation workstream — is promoted to a cross-cutting rule: the new **Matching Reasoning Effort to Stakes** section in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`. Set reasoning depth by the work's *blast radius × irreversibility × compounding cost* (the same risk lens Principles 3 and 9 already use); the inverse holds too, so cheap, reversible, mechanical work gets a lighter default. The rule is **agent-independent** — the brand-neutral core says *when and why*, while `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` names concrete example settings as the *how*. The heavy workstreams and both campaigns cite the rule, and an anti-erosion clause keeps it from becoming a license to skip a gate: a deeper mode sharpens a phase — it never crosses a hard gate (failure mode #17).
- **Backward compatible.** Adopters absorb the reasoning-effort edits to distributed files (`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`, `SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `workstreams/*`) by re-running `bin/sync`; the tutorials are not synced and need no adopter action. These are additive — no methodology-content semantics change.

### What's New in v2.8

The first non-docs change in several releases (since v2.2's distribution tooling): `bin/sync` and `bin/status` now cover the **full methodology corpus**, not the legacy three files. Resolves the **B1** campaign — issue [#32](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/32) — across four contributor PRs ([#33](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/33)/[#34](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/34)/[#35](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/35)/[#37](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/37), rmsharp). No principle, phase, gate, workstream, or failure-mode changes — this is tooling.

- **The gap it closes.** `bin/sync` propagated only `SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `SAFEGUARDS.md`, and `methodology_dashboard.py`; `bin/status` inspected the same three. Every release since v2.5 also changed files *outside* that set (`RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`, `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`, `workstreams/*`…), so adopters who synced "by the book" silently fell behind while `status` still reported `current` — **false confidence**.
- **Link reconciliation + `bin/check-links` (Phase 2, #33).** A distributed file's relative cross-references can't be correct in *both* the canonical repo layout and the adopter layout unless source and target are siblings in both ("the link-topology paradox"). Distributed files now author their cross-references for the **adopter** layout — extending the convention `SESSION_RUNNER.md` already followed — and a new `bin/check-links` validates every relative link against a simulated adopter tree (wired into `bin/tests.sh`). Tradeoff: those cross-boundary links resolve in an installed project but no longer when the canonical repo is browsed on GitHub.
- **Expanded `bin/sync` over a shared manifest (Phase 3, #34).** The flat three-file tuple becomes a `(src, dest, disposition)` manifest defined once in **`bin/_manifest.py`** — the single source of truth now read by `sync`, `status`, and `check-links`. `bin/sync` produces the full Option-B tree (operating files at the project root, framework under `docs/methodology/`, subdirectories created as needed) and adds a **`seed` disposition**: `SESSION_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` are written only when absent and never overwritten afterward — even with `--force` — because once created they are the adopter's.
- **Per-file `bin/status` (Phase 4, #35).** `status` reports one row per distributed file (`Project · File · Disposition · Status`) over the shared manifest, so drift in *any* framework doc — not just the legacy three — is now visible. SEED files report `present`/`absent` only, and an absent seed is never miscounted as drift. The test suite grew from 28 to 50.
- **Checker hygiene (Phase 5, [#37](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/37), closes [#36](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/36)).** `bin/check-links --tree` now validates a real project *in place* without writing to it — adopter-owned placeholder files (`CONTEXT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, …) are treated as allowed-absent rather than fabricated. The `--tree` mode added in Phase 3 had created up to 5 empty files in the validated tree; a Test 14 regression assertion now guards against it (suite at 51).
- **Backward compatible.** No methodology-content change; adopters pick up the full corpus by re-running `bin/sync`. Per-project customizations in `CLAUDE.md`'s Adaptations section are unaffected, locally-edited tracked files stay drift-protected, and seed files are never touched.

### What's New in v2.7.2

Docs-only dot release bundling three contributor fixes from the PR-14 review backlog — issues [#16](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/16), [#17](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/17), and [#19](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/19). No principle, phase, gate, workstream, or failure-mode changes.

- **Agent-level memory, named generically (#16).** `starter-kit/CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`'s "CONTEXT.md vs auto-memory" guidance becomes "CONTEXT.md vs **agent-level memory**" — the cross-project persistence layer is now named by what it does, not by Claude Code's brand term, with a gloss that other agents implement it under their own names (Cursor's memories, Cody's preferences). Keeps the methodology agent-independent.
- **A convention for citing skills from workstreams (#17).** `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` now states the rule the docs already followed: cite **one** recommended skill inline at the point of recommendation; promote **two or more** for the same workstream to a dedicated `## Recommended Skills` section with a purpose→skill table. `TEMPLATE_WORKSTREAM.md` ships a matching optional scaffold.
- **Cross-reference completeness as Learning #7 (#19).** A new Learnings-table row plus a Phase 3F pre-commit hook codify the self-review check `git diff` can't do for you: when you add a citation or grow a numbered set (failure modes, principles, learnings…), the defect is the *missing* destination-side edit — so grep each cited destination and each nearby count claim before committing.
- **Backward compatible.** Docs-only; adopters absorb the starter-kit changes (`CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`, `SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `TEMPLATE_WORKSTREAM.md`) via `bin/sync`.

### What's New in v2.7.1

Docs-only naming-consistency dot release resolving issue [#15](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/15). The methodology's two decimal-suffixed phase labels are renamed to the letter-suffix convention `SESSION_RUNNER.md` already uses, so the spec carries one consistent style for inserted sub-phases.

- **`Phase 1.5: Claim the Session` → `Phase 1B`** and **`Phase 2.5: Pre-Create Grill` → `Phase 2B`** in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`, each with a one-line clarifier: a letter suffix marks an *inserted bridge step* between two numbered phases — it does not subdivide a phase (there is no "Phase 1A"/"Phase 2A") and does not change the **"6 phases"** count.
- **Issue #15 scoped only Phase 2.5; the grep inventory found Phase 1.5 too** — the same "Claim the Session" step that `SESSION_RUNNER.md` and `CLAUDE.md` already call `1B`, rendered as a decimal here. Renaming only 2.5 would have left a fresh `1.5`-vs-`2B` split inside one file, so both decimals were standardized and the latent `1B`/`1.5` cross-doc inconsistency is closed in the same pass.
- **Live sites updated:** `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` (both headers + 2 body refs), the `SESSION_RUNNER.md` task-mapping row, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` (2 sites), and 3 campaign/workstream templates (`INHERITED_CODEBASE_FAMILIARIZATION_CAMPAIGN.md`, `TEMPLATE_CAMPAIGN.md`, `RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md`).
- **Changelog left verbatim by design.** Dated "What's New" entries below (v1.1 names `Phase 1.5`; v2.6 names `Phase 2.5`) and the frozen `docs/planning`/`docs/audits` records keep their original tokens — a changelog records what shipped under the name used at the time; this entry is the bridge.
- **Backward compatible.** No principle, phase, gate, workstream, or FM changes; the phase count is unchanged. Adopters absorb the starter-kit changes via `bin/sync`.

### What's New in v2.7

The first change to the unit of **"1 and done"** since the rule was written: one deliverable MAY now be a **verified vertical slice** — one capability end to end — under hard gates. Adopted from issues [#20](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/20) (model) and [#21](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/21) (guardrails).

- **Vertical-slice redefinition (#20).** The old "one horizontal layer per session" granularity was, in practice, a proxy for verifiability — a single sequential agent could only reliably verify a small blast radius. When a session has high-parallelism verification available, the proxy can relax *where the verification fully substitutes*. New `SESSION_RUNNER.md` §Vertical Slice Sessions defines four gates, all mandatory: **(a)** the full layer set pre-declared in a plan-mode contract before any code (a prior-session approval satisfies this; the implementing session re-verifies it at Orient); **(b)** a checkpoint commit at every layer boundary — the 5-file cap is unchanged and now explicitly *per-commit* (`SAFEGUARDS.md`); **(c)** the full build/test matrix plus exhaustive grep at *each* boundary, not once at the end; **(d)** per-surface *faithful* verification — "all tests ran" is not automatically faithful (a suite that bypasses row-level security passes a broken policy). **Evidence-gated, not self-certified:** missing per-boundary artifacts revert the session to horizontal scope at the last clean checkpoint. **Recoverability — not verifiability — is the ceiling on slice size**, and seven boundary types stay non-collapsible (irreversible migrations, operator-approval gates, plan ↔ implementation, cross-toolchain cutovers, and more). Principle 9 (Session Scope Bounding) extended to match.
- **Guardrails (#21).** New **failure mode #26 — "Mega-session masquerading as a vertical slice"** (appended; FMs 1–25 unchanged) with its own degradation-detection row: a slice is ONE capability mapped to ONE pre-declared layer list, and bundling two capabilities, two platform cutovers, or a plan + its code fails the slice test. **FM #17 (protocol erosion) gains an anti-erosion clause** — citing a "deeper dive" or any high-parallelism mode to skip an orientation, stub, or close-out step is erosion, not the model; *the allowance ADDS a gate, it removes no step*. **FM #18 (planning-to-implementation bleed) gains a discriminator** so pre-declared slices don't false-positive: implementing multiple layers of ONE pre-declared slice is not bundling.
- **Skills index restated.** The v2.6.2 forward-compatibility note is discharged: the "Phases spanned" reading guidance in `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` now speaks vertical-slice vocabulary (a skill's span must stay inside the slice's declared layer set, and a span never substitutes for a contract), and the "A skill is not a phase" principle paragraph no longer presupposes the strict horizontal model.
- **Backward compatible.** The allowance is opt-in and gated; the strict horizontal "1 and done" remains the default and the fallback. No phase, gate, or workstream changes. Adopters who never declare a slice operate the methodology exactly as before.

### What's New in v2.6.2

Docs-only dot release resolving issue [#22](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/22) (Pocock skill enablement gap — investigation by [@rmsharp](https://github.com/rmsharp)). Strategy decided: **C (Reactive)** — enablement support happens per-request via the adopter's own `CLAUDE.md` adaptations (or `/grill-with-docs` lazy-creation), never via methodology-shipped templates, preserving *"methodology recommends; methodology does not reimplement."*

- **New "Phases spanned (compression risk)" column** on the external-skills table in `starter-kit/RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` — the bounding half of strategy C. Records, per skill and verbatim-verified at the pinned SHAs, which phases one invocation can cross: `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture` are flagged **high** (Phase 2 → 3 → 5 in a single invocation); `/diagnose` is medium by design (a debugging session *is* its span); the rest are low/zero. A reading-guidance paragraph tells adopters to plan the stop point before invoking a high-compression skill, cross-referencing the "A skill is not a phase" principle. The column carries an explicit forward-compatibility note: if the vertical-slice model proposed in [#20](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/20)/[#21](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/21) is adopted, it gets restated in that vocabulary.
- **`/triage` prerequisite contradiction resolved by footnote** — the skill's body recommends `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`, which this index declines. The citation stands; a prerequisite note instructs adopters to establish the issue-tracker label mapping themselves per `DEVELOPMENT_WORKSTREAM.md` §Issue Lifecycle (or accept the canonical state names as-is).
- **Backward compatible.** No principle, phase, gate, workstream, or FM changes. Issues #20/#21 (vertical-slice model + guardrails) remain open and are not prejudged by this release.

### What's New in v2.6.1

Docs-only dot release bundling four external contributions (all from [@rmsharp](https://github.com/rmsharp) — PRs [#18](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/18), [#23](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/23), [#25](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/25), [#27](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/27)).

- **Skill-citation discipline completed** (PR #18) — closes the gaps left by v2.6:
  - The two aspirational citations in `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` are now real: `/init` gets an actual Claude Code helper paragraph in `BOOTSTRAP.md` Step 4 (greenfield scaffolder, with an explicit skip path for projects that already have a `CLAUDE.md`); `/fewer-permission-prompts` is dropped from the index (no natural citation site — the skill remains usable, the methodology just doesn't cite it).
  - **New principle: "A skill is not a phase"** in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` §Recommended Skills — a skill that pulls a session across a hard gate is failure mode #2 (keep-going) wearing a tool costume. Applies to every skill, indexed or independently installed; the methodology's gates bind every session regardless of which tools are loaded.
  - **New "Skills not recommended (and why)" subsection** in `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` — 10-row table surfacing the v2.6 audit's deliberate omissions (`/to-issues`, `/to-prd`, `/tdd`-as-workflow, `/caveman`, `/zoom-out`, `/write-a-skill`, `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`, `/loop`, `/schedule`) plus two hedged post-audit entries (`/handoff`, `/prototype`), each with a one-line rationale. Closes the door on re-litigation and makes the audit decisions discoverable from the index itself.
- **Learnings-routing contradiction fixed** (PR #25, closes #24) — `SESSION_RUNNER.md` Phase 3C no longer tells adopters to edit the synced Learnings table. Dual-audience recomposition: adopter projects record learnings in their `CLAUDE.md` Adaptations section; the canonical repo appends to the seed table. The false "table starts empty" caption is corrected; `HOW_TO_USE.md` retargeted to match.
- **CLAUDE.md size budget** (PR #27, closes #26) — `BOOTSTRAP.md` Step 5 gains a size-budget rule (~200-line target) with an extract-to-`PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` overflow valve, plus a warning to use a plain Markdown link (not an `@`-import) for the pointer so it stays read-on-demand.
- **Housekeeping** (PR #23) — `tools/__pycache__/` gitignored.
- **Backward compatible.** No principle, phase, gate, workstream, or session-type changes; no FM renumbering (count stays 25). Adopters absorb the starter-kit changes via `bin/sync`.

### What's New in v2.6

> **Methodology recommends; methodology does not reimplement.**

- **Skill-recommendation convention** — new content layer alongside phases, principles, workstreams, and campaigns. If a discipline can be expressed as a Claude Code skill (built-in like `/verify`, `/code-review`; community like Pocock's `/grill-me`, `/diagnose`), methodology cites the skill at the relevant phase or workstream instead of re-documenting the discipline in its own voice. Methodology owns *what to do and when*; skills own *how to do it*.
- **New `starter-kit/RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`** — canonical index of recommended skills with two tables (Pocock community skills + Claude Code built-ins). External entries include per-skill known-good commit SHAs for adopters who want to pin a verified version; Pocock entries carry a "fork for production reliance" note.
- **New `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` §Recommended Skills** — short principle paragraph + pointer to the index. Inline citations in workstreams and `SESSION_RUNNER.md` reference skills by slash-command name without re-describing them.
- **Conceptual content distilled from a 16-skill audit** (`docs/audits/2026-05-02-mattpocock-skills-evaluation.md`):
  - **FM #25 — Horizontal slicing** appended to `SESSION_RUNNER.md` (FMs 1–24 unchanged).
  - **Phase 3F / Phase 6 step 8** gain an explicit "remove debug instrumentation before commit" gate, citing `/diagnose` for the tagged-debug-log convention.
  - **New `starter-kit/CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`** — project-level domain-glossary template; **Phase 2 Research gains a new step 1** ("read CONTEXT.md if present"), citing `/grill-with-docs` for maintenance.
  - **New Issue Lifecycle section in `DEVELOPMENT_WORKSTREAM.md`** — 5-state machine (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) with transition rules, citing `/triage` for the workflow.
  - **New `Debugging Sessions` session type in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`** — naming + recognition only; cites `/diagnose` for the workflow.
  - **New Refactor Heuristics section in `ARCHITECTURE_WORKSTREAM.md`** — deepening + deletion-test heuristics from Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design*, citing `/improve-codebase-architecture` for the worked-session shape.
  - **New optional Phase 2.5 (Pre-Create Grill) in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`** + matching `SESSION_RUNNER.md` task-mapping row; cites `/grill-me` for the grill workflow.
  - **`starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md` Step 10** gains a tool-agnostic pre-commit hooks paragraph (cites `/setup-pre-commit` as one option) plus a mechanical-SAFEGUARDS-enforcement pointer to `/git-guardrails-claude-code`.
- **Refactor of existing content under the principle:**
  - `SESSION_RUNNER.md` §Phase 3E Runtime Smoke Test body shortened to a rule + citation of `/verify` and `/run`; intent preserved (the runtime-verify gate stays).
  - `AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` Light citation pass — new "Recommended Skills" callout cites `/code-review`, `/review`, `/security-review`. The 7-Dimension Audit Framework and per-phase audit framing stay as methodology-owned content.
- **Future-audit candidates flagged in release** (out of scope this release):
  - `AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` Medium/Heavy pass — per-phase citation audit beyond Light.
  - `RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md` — render-verification could cite `/verify`.
  - `SESSION_RUNNER.md` FM mechanical-enforcement column — depends on hook-conversion design.
  - `DEVELOPMENT_WORKSTREAM.md` citation audit beyond Issue Lifecycle.
- **Backward compatible.** No principle, phase, or quality-gate change. FM #25 appended (FMs 1–24 unchanged). Phase 2 step renumbered 1→2..7→8; the Phase 2 cross-references in `HOW_TO_USE.md` all cite by name, never by step number, so the renumber is safe. Adopters who never use the recommended skills continue to operate the methodology as written; the citations are recommendations, not hard dependencies.

### What's New in v2.5

- **Render-dependency completeness discipline** — closes the gap where rendering succeeds while the output silently uses fallback assets instead of the ones configured. Universal principle lands in `SAFEGUARDS.md` (new "Verify Render-Dependency Completeness" sub-section under "Verify the Build Equivalent"); concrete toolchain commands land in `RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md`. Resolves upstream issue [#12](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/12).
- **Two-tier check, by trigger:**
  - **Post-render** (e.g., `pdffonts` confirming all configured font faces actually embedded) — hard rule, part of the build-equivalent step, blocks commit on failure.
  - **Pre-render / setup** (e.g., `fc-list "<family>"` returning the expected face count; `kpsewhich` resolving per-face files) — soft prompt at Phase 0 when render-dep configuration changes.
- **Toolchain matrix gains a "Render-Dep Check" column** — per-toolchain canonical commands for Quarto, LaTeX, Sphinx, Pandoc, AsciiDoc, and (n/a) vanilla Markdown, listing static and post-render commands side-by-side.
- **New research-doc anti-pattern #20: Silent render-dependency fallback** — derived from the joy/ project's SBL BibLit case (Regular-only font, italic markup rendered as upright Latin glyphs for 47 sessions before being noticed visually). Mitigation cross-references the new toolchain column and SAFEGUARDS sub-section.
- **`RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md` updated** — Render Verification section in the creation-mode REPORT.md template gains a render-dep completeness line so the campaign inherits the discipline.
- **Backward compatible** — no principle, phase, gate, or workstream changes; no FM renumbering; existing adopters absorb the new SAFEGUARDS sub-section via `bin/sync`. Domain-specific commands live in the research-doc workstream and only affect projects that use it.

### What's New in v2.4

- **Multi-session campaigns promoted to first-class layer** — campaign templates are now an explicit layer in the document hierarchy alongside workstreams. New section in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` (`§Multi-Session Campaigns`); new orientation step in `SESSION_RUNNER.md` (Phase 1 multi-session campaign check); new `workstreams/TEMPLATE_CAMPAIGN.md` skeleton.
- **Realized examples:**
  - `workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md` — extends the Research Documentation workstream for exhaustive primary-source verification; decomposes the work into a planning → execution → consolidation campaign. Supports creation and audit modes.
  - `workstreams/INHERITED_CODEBASE_FAMILIARIZATION_CAMPAIGN.md` — extends the Audit workstream for taking over an unfamiliar codebase; feeds the Development workstream via a prioritized backlog. Supports interview mode (departing owner available) and archaeology mode (owner gone).
- **No new principles, phases, gates, or workstreams.** The change is structural-vocabulary only: it names the campaign layer that already exists in practice and gives it a documented home.

### What's New in v2.3

Combined release covering two contributions: a new Research Documentation workstream and a SESSION_RUNNER content release distilled from a 90-session field audit of `rad-con/SESSION_RUNNER.md` (issue #6 → audit doc → issue #7). FMs 1–23 are unchanged — no canonical renumbering.

**Research Documentation workstream**

- **New `workstreams/RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md`** — adapts the methodology for research papers, technical reports, dissertations, and regulatory analyses
- **Source-corpus management procedures** — pre-flag completeness audit, WAF retrieval hierarchy, filename verification, post-hoc dedup
- **Claim-source audit pattern** — every numeric, dated, or attributed claim requires a ≤40-word quoted passage from a primary source; baseline ~22% unsupported / ~12% re-attribution rate from real-world use
- **19 documented anti-patterns** specific to research documentation, including citation drift, filename trust, premature delete on audit-flagged claims, and goal-language for constraints
- **Toolchain adaptation table** — Quarto, LaTeX, Sphinx, Pandoc, AsciiDoc, and Markdown equivalents for citation checking, render commands, cross-reference verification, and figure scripts
- **Audit Mode** — adapts the workstream's machinery for fresh-eyes review of existing research repositories; uses the `AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` review-session pattern with this workstream's verification checklist as audit criteria, the 19 anti-patterns as finding categories, and the claim-source map as an audit sampling instrument

**SESSION_RUNNER content release**

- **New Phase 3E: Runtime Smoke Test** — if a deliverable changes runtime behavior (startup config, service registration, plugin loading, dispatch, integration wiring), launch the application and verify before committing. "Build clean" is necessary but not sufficient. Phase numbering shifts: old 3E (Commit) → 3F, old 3F (Report and STOP) → 3G.
- **New Failure Mode #24: Build-passes-ship-it** — appended (not inserted), so existing FM numbers 1–23 are unchanged. Catches sessions that treat `mvn clean package` / `npm run build` success as runtime correctness when the deliverable is integration behavior.
- **Phase 1B framing** — added "structural control, not a suggestion" line. Mandatory close-out steps are how clean-delivery streaks don't collapse.
- **Planning Sessions anecdote** — concrete cost of skipping evidence-based inventory: a planning session missed 10+ scattered references because it never ran grep; two greps would have found them all.
- **5 new Learnings rows:**
  - #2 — Protocol discipline is perishable (14 clean sessions can collapse to 1/10 in 12 hours)
  - #3 — Plans should flag "here be dragons" areas
  - #4 — Verify plan output against completion criteria, not session duration (refined from community feedback to remove "collapse multi-session work into a single session" framing — that phrasing read as license to bend "1 and done")
  - #5 — Code review is a distinct deliverable; produce actionable plans, not vague critique
  - #6 — A plan written from memory of a file read is an assumption-level claim
- **Backward compatible.** No FM renumbering. Phase rename only affects sessions or memories that cite "Phase 3E Commit" by number — adopters should grep their memory + project notes for that string and update to "Phase 3F Commit."

### What's New in v2.2

- **`bin/sync` tool** — dual-mode (`--mode=commit` / `--mode=ignore`) and dual-source (`--source=local` / `--source=github`) sync for starter-kit files. Committed mode is the existing pattern; ignored mode is new, for multi-project operators who want methodology updates to propagate via one command from a sibling `methodology/` checkout.
- **`bin/status` tool** — drift reporter across one or many projects. Shows `current`, `N versions behind`, `locally modified`, or `missing` per synced file.
- **Drift safety** — `bin/sync` refuses to overwrite files with local modifications (not matching canonical or any historical version). Pass `--force` to override, or move customizations to CLAUDE.md's Adaptations section first.
- **`starter-kit/CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`** — new template for project `CLAUDE.md` files, including the **Project-Specific Methodology Adaptations** section. This is the canonical seam for per-project customizations (task mappings, Phase 0 steps, project Learnings, project failure modes) — keeping synced files byte-identical to canonical.
- **BOOTSTRAP.md rewrite** — documents committed vs ignored modes, the customization seam pattern, and the updating workflow (`bin/status` → `bin/sync`).
- **Backward compatible** — existing adopters on v2.1 who copy files manually continue to work unchanged. The scripted workflow is additive.

### What's New in v2.1

- **CHANGELOG.md and ROADMAP.md templates** — new starter-kit files that split task tracking into three focused files: BACKLOG.md (open work only), CHANGELOG.md (completed work history), ROADMAP.md (feature inventory and future plans)
- **Migration guide** — step-by-step instructions in BOOTSTRAP.md for projects with an existing monolithic BACKLOG.md
- **4 new failure modes** (#20-23): edit from memory, greenfield assumption, overwrite user edits, question-as-instruction
- **Artifact Integrity section** in SAFEGUARDS.md — read before edit, preserve user edits, verify the build equivalent
- **Build equivalent step** — new Step 6 in BOOTSTRAP.md for identifying and recording the project's verification command
- **Documentation project adaptations** — adaptation table and anti-patterns in TEMPLATE_WORKSTREAM.md, expanded audit scope in AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md
- **Dashboard compliance updated** — methodology dashboard now checks for CHANGELOG.md and ROADMAP.md presence (6 → 8 required items)
- **Consistent references** — SAFEGUARDS.md, SESSION_RUNNER.md, and README updated to reference the three-file approach

### What's New in v2.0

- **Methodology Dashboard** — new portfolio health scanner (`tools/methodology_dashboard.py`) that scores projects on 5 dimensions (activity, testing, documentation, CI/CD, methodology compliance) and generates a self-contained HTML dashboard
- **Two scanning modes** — portfolio mode (scans sibling git repos) and single-project mode (scans the project + git submodules), auto-detected based on placement
- **Health scoring (0-100)** with 5 weighted dimensions and rule-based risk assessment (critical/high/medium/low flags)
- **Methodology compliance scoring (0-100)** — weighted checklist of required methodology items (SESSION_RUNNER, SAFEGUARDS, SESSION_NOTES, BACKLOG, docs/methodology/, workstreams/)
- **Color-coded terminal output** — at-a-glance status without opening the browser
- **Live HTML dashboard** — auto-refreshes every 60 seconds; collapsible project cards sortable by health, risk, name, or activity
- **Starter kit includes dashboard** — `starter-kit/methodology_dashboard.py` for per-project use
- **Zero dependencies** — Python 3 stdlib only, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### What's New in v1.2

- **Planning session discipline** — plans are deliverables, not preambles. A planning session closes out after the plan; implementation is a separate session.
- **Evidence-based inventory** — plans that involve deletion, migration, or renaming must include grep-based inventories of all affected symbols. No more assumption-based file lists.
- **Per-phase completion criteria** — every phase in a multi-phase plan must state what DONE looks like, verification commands, and an explicit session boundary.
- **Plan-mode exit trap** — explicit warning that Plan Mode's "Implement the following plan" preamble does NOT mean start coding. The plan is a draft until evidence-verified.
- **2 new failure modes** (#18-19): planning-to-implementation bleed, plan-mode bypass
- **2 new degradation detection signs** for planning discipline violations
- **Planning Session Checklist** — 5-item verification before closing a planning session
- **Learnings table** added to Session Runner — institutional memory that grows with each session

### What's New in v1.1

- **Protocol Erosion section** — documents how methodology discipline degrades over time and how to detect it early
- **Phase 1.5: Claim the Session** — write a stub before starting work so even crashed sessions leave a trace
- **Minimum Handoff Requirements** — 6 mandatory items with bad/good examples; "pick next from backlog" is explicitly called out as insufficient
- **Ghost session detection** — Phase 0 now checks for undocumented sessions between the last notes and current state
- **Fabrication warning** — honest accounting now explicitly addresses false credit and fabricated quotes
- **4 new failure modes** (#14-17): ghost sessions, minimal handoffs, fabrication, protocol erosion
- **Degradation Detection table** — 7 warning signs with responses
- **Quality Gates expanded** from 10 to 12
