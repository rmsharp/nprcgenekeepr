## [Unreleased]

### 2026-06-16 — Complete the `fillBins()` `@return` documentation (#33) (Session 92)
- **Deliverable:** Completed the `@return` roxygen for the `@noRd` internal `fillBins()` (`R/fillBins.R:6`) — replaced the `#' @return  A list with two TODO: RMS provide description` placeholder with a `\describe{}` block documenting both returned elements (`males`/`females` = integer vectors of counts per age bin). **Docs-only on a non-exported internal** (no `R/` behavior, NAMESPACE, `man/`, or DESCRIPTION change). Workstream = development under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response; gates via `AskUserQuestion` (pre-RED test-approach scope, PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN, GREEN→REFACTOR); **0 stakeholder corrections**.
- **RED driver (since `@noRd` ⇒ no `man/*.Rd` for the S87 `Rd2ex` pattern):** a doc-completeness test in `tests/testthat/test_fillBins.R` reads `R/fillBins.R` via `testthat::test_path("..","..","R","fillBins.R")` with `skip_if(!file.exists(...))` for the installed context, **extracts only the `@return` block** (between the `@return` tag and the next roxygen tag), and asserts no `TODO` plus both `\bmales\b`/`\bfemales\b` — scoping to the block so the title's existing `\code{males}`/`\code{females}` can't falsely satisfy it (3 failures RED at HEAD, all for the right reason; the failure output proved the extractor isolated only the `@return` line).
- **Contract-lock guard (green at HEAD, honestly classified):** a behavioral `test_that` asserting `fillBins(pedOne, seq(0L,20L,5L))` returns a list named `c("males","females")`, both `expect_type` `"integer"`, `expect_length == length(lowerAges)` — verifies the docs match real behavior and guards future drift.
- **Verification:** `test_fillBins.R` 11/11 green; `devtools::document()` produced **no** NAMESPACE/`man/`/DESCRIPTION change (confirms the `@noRd` path); `lintr` 0 on `R/fillBins.R` and the test file; full clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error** (5 warnings = the designed `loadSiteConfig` safety-net logs; 169 skips). **[news-vs-changelog]:** `@noRd` internal docs never render to a user-facing man page → **CHANGELOG only**, no `NEWS`. Phase-3E (runtime smoke test) **N/A** — a roxygen comment on a `@noRd` internal changes no runtime behavior (stated, not silently skipped). #33 left OPEN pending owner confirmation.

### 2026-06-16 — Behavioral upload-path regression tests for #4; close #4 (Session 90)
- **Deliverable:** Finalized issue **#4** — CLOSED it on owner confirmation (the fix shipped in S89, `8a3e3631`, was Phase-3E-verified) and added behavioral regression coverage for the Shiny UPLOAD path that S89 had covered only structurally (a `deparse(body(modInputServer))` grep). Two NEW test files; **test-only** (no `R/`/NAMESPACE/`man/`/DESCRIPTION change). Workstream = development under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, gates via `AskUserQuestion` (pre-RED scope, PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN, GREEN→REFACTOR, **+ a mid-GREEN reframe** when investigation changed what was testable), **0 stakeholder corrections**.
- **NEW `tests/testthat/test_modInput_incomplete_final_line.R` (normal suite, in-process):** drives `modInputServer`'s `getData` observer via `shiny::testServer` with a TINY (4-line) no-trailing-newline upload through both reader branches (read.csv + read.table) and asserts (a) the `"incomplete final line"` warning does NOT escape the read and (b) all 3 founder records survive QC. **Carries the fix-specific teeth:** un-muffling either read site makes both blocks RED (round-trip verified S90); restoring → green.
- **NEW `tests/testthat/test-e2e-input-incomplete-final-line.R` (opt-in `NPRC_RUN_E2E`, browser):** drives the assembled app via `shinytest2::AppDriver`, uploads a no-trailing-newline copy of `ExamplePedigree.csv` through both reader paths, and asserts the cleaned studbook flows end-to-end into the Pedigree Browser table (all **3,694** records). Full-stack data-integrity net.
- **Key discovery (drove the two-test design; cost several cycles):** the `"incomplete final line"` warning is (1) a *console-only* artifact that never reaches the DOM or `app$get_logs()` in the assembled app, AND (2) only fires for *small* files — `read.table`/`read.csv` warn only when the header/type-detection scan actually reaches the unterminated final line, so a realistic-size file (e.g. 3694-row `ExamplePedigree.csv`) never triggers it. ⇒ the warning-suppression cannot be teeth-tested in a browser; the **testServer** test (tiny fixture, in-process where the warning IS observable) owns that teeth, and the **browser E2E** owns end-to-end processing.
- **Verification:** testServer test 6/6 green; teeth round-trip (un-muffle both sites → both blocks RED → restore → green) confirmed; browser E2E 2/2 green (opt-in, drives the INSTALLED app via real Chrome); full clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error** (195 files; 5 warnings = the designed `loadSiteConfig` safety-net logs); all test lines ≤80. **Phase-3E:** the browser E2E IS the runtime verification (drove the installed app); the testServer test drives the real module server. **Issue #4 CLOSED.**
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** test-only (the user-facing fix landed in NEWS at S89) → **CHANGELOG only**.
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 88 added.

### 2026-06-16 — Fix #4: suppress the "incomplete final line" warning on files with no trailing newline (Session 89)
- **Deliverable:** Fixed issue **#4** — reading an animal list or pedigree file whose final line lacks a trailing newline emitted `"incomplete final line found by readTableHeader on '...'"` (originally reported from a Shiny text upload, `0.txt`). Reproduced firsthand that this is **noise, not data loss**: every row, including the last, is read correctly (`nrow == 3`); only the warning is the problem. Owner chose the **root-cause fix across all readers via a shared helper** (over fixing only the reported upload path). Workstream = development under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, **3 gates** via `AskUserQuestion` (PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN, GREEN→REFACTOR) **+ a separate pre-RED scope question** (all-readers-via-helper vs named-readers vs app-only), **0 stakeholder corrections**.
- **RED:** NEW `tests/testthat/test_muffleIncompleteFinalLine.R` (7 tests): helper unit teeth — a no-trailing-newline read emits **no** warning *and* preserves every row; an unrelated `warning("...")` **still propagates** (proves it is surgical, not blanket `suppressWarnings`); the helper returns `expr`'s value unchanged. Integration — `getPedigree()`/`getGenotypes()` emit no warning + preserve rows; `getFocalAnimalPed()` emits no `"incomplete final line"` warning (its post-read LabKey call returns an error list without a DB; the unrelated config-missing warning is acceptable); and `modInputServer`'s body references the helper (structural lock for the server-internal `readDataFile` closure). All 7 failed at HEAD for the right reason (helper missing → 3 errors; readers still warn → fail; body lacks the wrap → fail).
- **GREEN:** NEW non-exported `@noRd` internal helper `R/muffleIncompleteFinalLine.R` = `withCallingHandlers(expr, warning = ...)` that `invokeRestart("muffleWarning")` **only** when `conditionMessage` matches `"incomplete final line"` (all other warnings propagate). Wrapped the read call at each of the four sites: `getPedigree.R`, `getGenotypes.R` (`read.table`), `getFocalAnimalPed.R` (`read.csv`), and `modInput.R`'s `readDataFile` (both the text `read.table` and CSV `read.csv` branches). No new imports (base functions). `document()` produced **no** NAMESPACE/`man/`/DESCRIPTION change (helper is `@noRd`; reader signatures unchanged). **REFACTOR = confirmed no-op** (helper + wraps already minimal/idiomatic/lint-clean).
- **Verification:** new file **7/7 green** (12 expectations); full clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error** (192 files, 1046 tests, 167 skips; the 5 warnings are S85's designed `loadSiteConfig` safety-net logs); `lintr` **0 lints** on all 5 changed `R/` files. **Phase-3E = PERFORMED, PASS:** `devtools::install()` then exercised the exported readers in the **installed** package — `getPedigree`/`getGenotypes` on no-newline files emit no warning and preserve all rows; `getFocalAnimalPed` no longer emits the incomplete-final-line warning **but its unrelated config-missing warning still propagates** (surgical proof); a control file *with* a trailing newline still reads cleanly.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** user-facing file-reading bug fix → **BOTH** `NEWS.Rmd`→`NEWS.md` (new bullet under `1.1.0.9000` → Data input / quality control; rendered from source, diff = only that bullet) **and** this CHANGELOG entry. **Issue #4 left OPEN** pending owner confirmation (standing close-only-on-owner-confirmation rule).
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 87 added.

### 2026-06-16 — Housekeeping: About-tab version derived from DESCRIPTION (stale "Version 1.0.8" → dynamic getVersion()) (Session 88)
- **Deliverable:** Replaced the stale hard-coded `Version 1.0.8` strings (carried since S56) with the current package version. The runtime fix: the Shiny **About** panel (`R/appUI.R:230`) now renders `paste("Version", getVersion(date = FALSE))`, reusing the existing exported `getVersion()` helper (which reads `packageVersion("nprcgenekeepr")`) so the displayed version tracks `DESCRIPTION` (`1.1.0.9000`) and can never drift again — the root-cause fix the owner chose over a hard-coded literal. The `CLAUDE.md` project-overview prose was updated to `1.1.0.9000` as a plain doc edit. Workstream = development under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, 3 gates via `AskUserQuestion` (PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN, GREEN→REFACTOR) + a separate pre-RED approach question (dynamic vs hard-coded), **0 stakeholder corrections**.
- **RED:** NEW `tests/testthat/test_appUI_version.R` renders `as.character(appUI())` and, **scoped to the About panel** (the region following its `About GeneKeepR` heading), asserts it shows `Version <packageVersion>` and not the stale `Version 1.0.8`. Scoping was essential: the app already shows a *dynamic* version in its title bar (`appUI.R:47`, `getVersion()` with build date), so an un-scoped positive assertion was a **false pass** at HEAD — it matched the title-bar string, not the About tab. After scoping, both assertions failed for the right reason at HEAD.
- **GREEN (2 edits, no `document()`):** `R/appUI.R:230` `p("Version 1.0.8")` → `p(paste("Version", getVersion(date = FALSE)))`; `CLAUDE.md` overview `(Version 1.0.8)` → `(Version 1.1.0.9000)`. Body-only change to `appUI()` → no `.Rd`/NAMESPACE/DESCRIPTION change (`utils` already imported; `getVersion` already exported). **REFACTOR = confirmed no-op** (the fix reuses the existing helper and is minimal/idiomatic).
- **Verification:** new test 3/3 green; full clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error** (5 warnings = the designed `loadSiteConfig` safety-net logs from S85); `lintr` **0 lints** on `R/appUI.R`. **Phase-3E = PERFORMED, PASS:** `devtools::install()` + a `shinytest2::AppDriver` boot of the **installed** stock app confirmed the live About panel renders `<p>Version 1.1.0.9000</p>` with the stale `1.0.8` absent.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** user-facing (the displayed app version) → **BOTH** `NEWS.Rmd`→`NEWS.md` (new bullet under `1.1.0.9000` → Shiny application; rendered from source, diff = only that bullet) **and** this CHANGELOG entry.
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 86 added.

### 2026-06-16 — Docfix sweep: roxygen @examples corrections + dedicated tests for two zero-coverage functions (Session 87)
- **Deliverable:** Owner-scoped **full sweep + tests**. (1) Corrected the roxygen `@examples` for three exported functions whose documented example never invoked the function it documents; (2) added dedicated unit tests for `kinshipMatrixToKValues()` and `getAncestors()`, which previously had **zero direct test references** in `tests/testthat/`. Workstream = development (documentation + test backfill) under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, 3 gates via `AskUserQuestion` (PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN, GREEN→REFACTOR) + a separate pre-RED scope question, **0 stakeholder corrections**.
- **Evidence-based scope (read-only sweep across all exported functions):** 5 functions had an `@examples` block that never calls its own function; 3 are real defects, 2 are S3-dispatch false positives (`summary.nprcgenekeeprErr` / `print.summary.nprcgenekeeprErr`, correctly demonstrated via the `summary()`/auto-print generic — left untouched).
- **@examples fixes (3, GREEN):** `getPedDirectRelatives` (severe — example called `getLkDirectRelatives(ids = ...)`, the wrong function, and omitted the required `ped`; now `getPedDirectRelatives(ids = "E", ped = nprcgenekeepr::lacy1989Ped)`); `cumulateSimKinships` (final call was `createSimKinships(...)` → now `cumulateSimKinships(ped, allSimParents, pop, n = 10)`); `getIdsWithOneParent` (added a closing `getIdsWithOneParent(p)` call). `document()` regenerated only the 3 corresponding `man/*.Rd`; NAMESPACE unchanged (no new exports).
- **RED:** NEW `tests/testthat/test_examples_invoke_documented_fn.R` extracts each function's `@examples` from `man/<fn>.Rd` via `tools::Rd2ex` (skips under an installed package with no `man/`) and asserts the example calls `<fn>(`, plus that `getPedDirectRelatives` does **not** call `getLkDirectRelatives(`. 4 assertions failed for the right reason at HEAD; all GREEN after the fixes.
- **Coverage backfill (honest degenerate cycle, declared):** NEW `tests/testthat/test_kinshipMatrixToKValues.R` (shape, `n + n(n-1)/2` row count, orientation-agnostic coefficient lookups, named/unnamed matrices) and `tests/testthat/test_getAncestors.R` (founder/NA → `character(0)`, one- and multi-generation lineages with exact order + setequal, and a `createPedTree(lacy1989Ped)` integration check). The functions already ship correctly, so these pass from the start; expected values were independently hand-derived and **teeth-checked** (perturbing an expected value fails).
- **Verification:** all 3 fixed examples run clean end-to-end (`tools::Rd2ex` → `source`), the docs build-equivalent per SAFEGUARDS; full clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error** (the 5 warnings are the designed `loadSiteConfig` safety-net logs from S85); `lintr` **0 lints** on the 3 changed `R/` files; new test files ≤80 cols by hand (`.lintr` excludes `tests/`). **REFACTOR = confirmed no-op** (edits and tests already minimal and idiomatic). **Phase-3E runtime smoke = N/A** — documentation + tests only, no runtime behavior change (stated, not silently skipped).
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** the `getPedDirectRelatives` example was a user-facing help defect (wrong function shown in `?getPedDirectRelatives`) → **BOTH** `NEWS.Rmd`→`NEWS.md` (new Documentation bullet under `1.1.0.9000` Minor changes; rendered from source, diff = only that bullet) **and** this CHANGELOG entry.
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 85 added.

### 2026-06-16 — Durable opt-in E2E for the ONPRC-gated ORIP Reporting tab (#47, #49, Session 86)
- **Deliverable:** NEW `tests/testthat/test-e2e-orip-module.R` — a durable, opt-in (`NPRC_RUN_E2E=true`) browser-driven regression test for the **ORIP Reporting** tab wired in S83 (#47) and ONPRC-gated in S84 (#49). Drives the assembled modular app (`appUI()`/`appServer`) through `shinytest2::AppDriver` and asserts the build-time gate **end-to-end, both polarities**. Workstream = development (regression backfill) under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, 3 gates via `AskUserQuestion`, **0 stakeholder corrections**. **Test-only — no `R/`, `man/`, `NAMESPACE`, or `NEWS` changes.**
- **Four opt-in blocks** (each `skip_if_not_installed("shinytest2"/"chromote")` + `skip_on_cran()` + the `create_test_app()` opt-in gate): (1) **ONPRC config → tab accessible** (active pane + the module's unique body text); (2) **ONPRC → content + download** — `#oripReporting-siteInfo` reports `Center=ONPRC`, the Export ORIP Report button is present, and `app$get_download("oripReporting-downloadORIPReport")` yields a `Category/Metric/Value` CSV with a `Center=ONPRC` Site row (deterministic — the handler writes the Site section even with no pedigree loaded); (3) **no config (stock app) → tab ABSENT** (`navigate_to_tab` returns FALSE AND `oripReporting-` absent from the body); (4) **SNPRC config → tab ABSENT** (proves the gate keys on `center`, not mere config presence).
- **Config-injecting fixture:** a local `build_config_app_dir(center)` writes a temp `app.R` that `Sys.setenv(HOME=<temp dir with a complete documented-format .nprcgenekeepr_config>)` BEFORE `shinyApp(appUI(), appServer)` — S84/S85's HOME-override Phase-3E recipe promoted to a reusable test fixture (the positive case can't use the stock app, which has no config → tab hidden; the no-config negative case rides the stock `create_test_app()` app for free). It reuses the opt-in gate by calling `create_test_app()` for its skip side-effect — **no change to the shared `helper-shinytest2.R`**.
- **RED (honest degenerate cycle):** behavior already ships, so RED = author teeth-bearing assertions + confirm all 4 blocks self-skip cleanly with opt-in OFF (`SSSS`, 0 fail/error) — no literal red-to-green.
- **GREEN:** independently confirmed the three gate outcomes in-process FIRST (`getSiteInfo()` parse → `shouldShowOripTab()`: ONPRC→TRUE, SNPRC→FALSE, no-config→FALSE), `devtools::install(quick=TRUE)`, then ran all 4 blocks with `NOT_CRAN=true NPRC_RUN_E2E=true` against the installed app → **9/9 expectations PASS** (real Chrome via `chromote`).
- **REFACTOR:** reflowed 6 over-length lines to ≤80 (split the long `lkPedColumns` config line into the shipped example config's multi-line format); re-verified parsing + a fresh 9/9 browser run.
- **Verification:** full clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error** with this file **4-skipped** in the normal (opt-in-off) run; `lintr` clean (`tests/` is excluded in `.lintr`, consistent with prior sessions). The browser E2E run IS the Phase-3E runtime verification (FM #24 answered head-on).
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** test-only addition (no `R/` code, no user-facing feature; the ORIP feature itself landed in `NEWS.md` at S83/S84) → **CHANGELOG only**.
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 84 added.

### 2026-06-15 — Fix modular-app boot crash on a documented-format config file (#50, Session 85)
- **Deliverable:** Fixed **#50** — the modular app's config-loading observer (`R/appServer.R:58-68`) used `read.table(configFile, header=TRUE, sep="=")`, which cannot parse the **documented** config format (`inst/extdata/example_nprcgenekeepr_config`: comment lines, blank lines, multi-line / quoted / comma-separated values) and stopped with *"line N did not have 2 elements"*. The observer was not wrapped in `tryCatch`, so the error propagated and `runModularApp()` failed to reach a stable state on boot for any deployment with such a config file present. Workstream = development under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, 3 gates via `AskUserQuestion` + a separate pre-RED approach question, 0 stakeholder corrections.
- **Decision (owner, via `AskUserQuestion`):** **Single source of truth** (issue's suggested fix #1) over a minimal `tryCatch`-only patch — parse via the tolerant `getSiteInfo()` path so documented-format configs actually load, not merely fail-soft. Safe because `shared$config` is passed to `modInputServer`/`modPedigreeServer` but **referenced by neither module body** (verified by grep), so changing its shape from data.frame to the `getSiteInfo()` named list has no runtime consumer impact.
- **RED:** NEW `tests/testthat/test_loadSiteConfig.R` (5 tests / 8 expectations): no-file → `NULL`; documented `example_nprcgenekeepr_config` → list with `center=="SNPRC"` & `lkPedColumns>=6` (THE crash case); malformed config (missing `center`) → `NULL`, no throw (`tryCatch` safety net); a characterization guard that `read.table(sep="=")` errors on the documented file (root-cause lock, green throughout); and a structural `deparse(appServer)` assertion (uses `loadSiteConfig`, not `read.table`). The behavioral + structural assertions failed for the right reason at HEAD (undefined function / observer still on `read.table`); the characterization guard passed.
- **GREEN (2 edits + document()):** NEW exported `R/loadSiteConfig.R` = `getConfigFileName(Sys.info())` → `NULL` if no file, else `tryCatch(getSiteInfo(expectConfigFile = FALSE), error → flog.warn + NULL)`; rewrote the `appServer` observer to `shared$config <- loadSiteConfig()`. `document()` regenerated NAMESPACE export + `man/loadSiteConfig.Rd`. **REFACTOR:** added a bidirectional `@seealso \link{loadSiteConfig}` to `appServer`'s roxygen (re-documented); no behavior change.
- **Verification:** new tests 8/8 green; full clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error**; `lintr` **0 lints** on all 3 changed files (the transient `object_usage` warning for the brand-new function cleared after `devtools::install()`).
- **Phase-3E (runtime smoke): PERFORMED — PASS.** `AppDriver` boot of the installed app with the **real documented `example_nprcgenekeepr_config` (SNPRC) present** (HOME-override-in-`app.R` recipe) — the exact file that crashed boot before. App reached a stable state (`mainNavbar`="Home"), navigation to "Genetic Value Analysis" worked, **0** `read.table`/"did not have 2 elements" crash lines, **0** non-`shinyBS` error-level logs. This is the boot S84 had to sidestep with a stripped single-line config; the documented format now boots clean.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** user-facing (a startup-crash bug fix) → **BOTH** `NEWS.Rmd`→`NEWS.md` (new bug-fix bullet under `1.1.0.9000`, rendered from source; diff = only that bullet) **and** this CHANGELOG entry.
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 83 added.

### 2026-06-15 — Gate the ORIP Reporting tab to ONPRC-only (#49) + owner-confirmed close of #47 (Session 84)
- **Deliverable (1):** Owner-confirmed close of **#47** (the ORIP wire-in shipped S83). The owner accepted the always-visible v1; **#47 CLOSED** with a comment referencing commit `6fd16715` and the 13/13 Phase-3E smoke, noting the ONPRC-gating follow-up is #49.
- **Deliverable (2):** Implemented **#49** — the **ORIP Reporting** tab is now shown **only for ONPRC**. Workstream = development under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, 3 gates via `AskUserQuestion` + a separate pre-RED scope/approach question, 0 stakeholder corrections.
- **Decisions (owner, via `AskUserQuestion`):** (a) **Hide unless a real ONPRC config** — show only when an actual config file exists AND its `center` is ONPRC; the `getSiteInfo()` default fallback (`center="ONPRC"` with no file, true in dev/CI) hides the tab. (b) **Build-time conditional `tabPanel`** (not dynamic `insertTab`) — the deployment center is fixed per server and `appUI()` is evaluated once at construction, so the tab's presence is a per-deployment constant.
- **RED:** NEW `tests/testthat/test_shouldShowOripTab.R` (5 pure-predicate cases) + rewrote `tests/testthat/test_modORIPReporting.R` to inject a `siteInfo` list and assert the tab is PRESENT under ONPRC+real-file and ABSENT under SNPRC / no-file, plus a `deparse(appServer)` assertion that the server mount is gated on `shouldShowOripTab`. All failed for the right reason (undefined function / unused `siteInfo` arg / un-gated mount).
- **GREEN (3 edits):** NEW exported `R/shouldShowOripTab.R` (`isTRUE(hasConfigFile) && isTRUE(center == "ONPRC")`, mirroring `shouldShowChangedColsTab`); parameterized `appUI(siteInfo = getSiteInfo(expectConfigFile = FALSE))` with a conditional ORIP `tabPanel`; gated the `modORIPReportingServer` mount in `appServer.R` on the same predicate. `document()` regenerated NAMESPACE + `man/`. REFACTOR = no-op (kept the inline-call idiom; no helper extraction).
- **Verification:** new tests pass (5/5 + 4/4); full clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error**; `lintr` **0 lints** on all 5 changed files (the transient `object_usage` warning for the brand-new function clears once the package is installed).
- **Phase-3E (runtime smoke): PERFORMED — PASS (3/3 scenarios).** `AppDriver` boots of the installed app under three real config-file scenarios (each generated `app.R` sets `HOME` to a temp config dir): **ONPRC** → tab present, navigable, all 5 ORIP outputs register values, 4 siblings intact; **SNPRC** → tab absent (UI + server), siblings intact; **no config** → tab absent, siblings intact. 0 ORIP-namespaced errors (only the pre-existing app-wide `shinyBS` noise).
- **Discovered (out of scope) → filed #50:** the pre-existing config-loading observer (`appServer.R:63`, from commit `6457a3a3`) calls `read.table(configFile, header=TRUE, sep="=")`, which CANNOT parse the documented config format (comments, blank lines, multi-line quoted values) and **crashes the modular app on boot** whenever such a config file is present. Surfaced by this session's Phase-3E (first app boot WITH a config file). NOT fixed here (unrelated to #49); filed as **#50**.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** user-facing (visible-tab behavior change) → **BOTH** `NEWS.Rmd`→`NEWS.md` (ORIP bullet augmented with the ONPRC-gating note, rendered from source; diff = only that bullet) **and** this CHANGELOG entry.
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 82 added.

### 2026-06-15 — Wire in the ORIP Reporting module (#47, Session 83)
- **Deliverable:** Mounted the existing-but-unwired `modORIPReporting` module pair into the application — a new **ORIP Reporting** tab (after Summary Statistics). Two production edits: `R/appUI.R` (`tabPanel` with `modORIPReportingUI("oripReporting")`) and `R/appServer.R` (`modORIPReportingServer("oripReporting", pedigree=…, geneticValues=…, siteConfig=…)`). Implements **#47** (left OPEN pending owner-confirmed close, per the standing rule + the #48 precedent). Workstream = development under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, 3 gates via `AskUserQuestion` + a separate PRE-RED UX-fork question (tab placement), 0 stakeholder corrections.
- **RED:** New `tests/testthat/test_modORIPReporting.R` — 2 wiring tests (4 expectations) mirroring `test_modGvAndBgDesc.R`'s mount idiom: (1) `as.character(appUI())` must contain the `oripReporting-` namespace **and** "Office of Research Infrastructure Programs"; (2) `deparse(appServer)` must contain `modORIPReportingServer` **and** `oripReporting`. All 4 failed for the right reason at HEAD (markers absent); no module unit tests needed (the module is already tested in `test_modSiteConfig.R`).
- **GREEN/REFACTOR:** 2 edits matching the 7 sibling tabPanel/server-call idioms → 4/4 pass; full suite 0 failed / 0 error; `lintr` 0 lints on all 3 changed files; `document()` no-op (module already `@export`'d, NAMESPACE/man unchanged). REFACTOR was a confirmed no-op (edits already idiomatic).
- **Phase-3E (runtime smoke): PERFORMED — PASS (13/13).** Headless `AppDriver` boot of the installed app: ORIP tab link + all 5 namespaced outputs/buttons + body text render; `mainNavbar` navigates to it (active pane shows "Export ORIP Report"); 4 sibling tabs intact; **0 `oripReporting`-namespaced JS errors** (the 12 `shinyBS` errors are pre-existing app-wide noise, separated by namespace grep). Reused Learning 78's recipe (`NOT_CRAN=true` + `devtools::install()` first).
- **Owner-clarified follow-up → #49 filed:** the tab ships **always-visible** this session; the owner clarified ORIP reporting is **ONPRC-specific** and the tab should be **gated on an Oregon-specific config**. That conditional-presentation change is deferred to new issue **#49** (out of scope here, per 1-and-done).
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** user-facing (a new visible tab) → **BOTH** `NEWS.Rmd`→`NEWS.md` (new "Shiny application" bullet under `1.1.0.9000`, rendered from source) **and** this CHANGELOG entry. The module was previously listed in NEWS only as an existing *module file*, never as a reachable feature.

### 2026-06-15 — Durable opt-in E2E test for the Potential Parents tab (Session 82)
- **Deliverable:** Added `tests/testthat/test-e2e-potential-parents-module.R` — a durable, opt-in browser E2E test for the shipped **#48** "Potential Parents" tab, mirroring the sibling `test-e2e-*-module.R` pattern. Closes the literal full-browser-chain gap S80 (mount-only AppDriver smoke + `testServer`) and S81 (one owner click-through) both flagged. Workstream = development (test backfill) under **Strict TDD** — phase declared every response, 3 gates via `AskUserQuestion`, 0 stakeholder corrections.
- **Regression backfill ⇒ no production code:** the feature already shipped (S80) and was owner-verified (S81), so this adds only a test (no `R/`, `man/`, `NAMESPACE`, or `NEWS.md` changes). The degenerate RED→GREEN was declared honestly at the gate: RED = assertions with teeth that self-skip when `NPRC_RUN_E2E` is off; GREEN = run against the shipped feature; REFACTOR = lint.
- **4 opt-in `AppDriver` blocks:** (1) tab accessible; (2) controls present (gestation input / Find button / Download CSV); (3) **populated path** — upload `rhesusPedigree_fromCenter.csv` → Pedigree Browser → Potential Parents → `maxGestationalPeriod=210` → Find → assert status *"Found candidate parents for 50 animal"* + table *"of 50 entries"* + downloaded CSV = 50 rows & header `id,nSires,nDams,sires,dams`; (4) graceful degradation — `ExamplePedigree.csv` → Find → *"colony-origin"* warning. The `50` regression lock was independently re-derived through the app's exact pipeline (both the filtered `pedigreeData` and full `processedPedigree` variants give 50) before the browser run.
- **Verification:** `devtools::install(quick=TRUE)` (E2E drives the installed copy) → `NOT_CRAN=true NPRC_RUN_E2E=true` single-file run → **7/7 expectations PASS, 0 fail/skip/error** in a real Chrome browser (this is the Phase-3E runtime verification) → clean-regression read **0 failed / 0 error / 0 true offenders** with the file skipping cleanly in the normal suite → `lintr` 0 lints.
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 80 added (backfilling a regression E2E under strict TDD: honest degenerate cycle, re-derive the locked value through the exact pipeline, browser-E2E-is-Phase-3E, preserve the sibling idiom).

### 2026-06-15 — Owner-confirmed close of #48 + clean fromCenter example dataset (Session 81)
- **Deliverable:** Owner-confirmed close of **#48** (the getPotentialParents "Potential Parents" tab shipped S80), gated on a **live owner click-through** verified end-to-end. Workstream = verification + issue-management (**TDD phase = N/A** — added an example dataset + diagnosis, no production logic/tests).
- **Live click-through (Phase 3E, owner-run): PASS.** Part A graceful degradation (`ExamplePedigree.csv` → "no fromCenter field" empty-state); Part B populated path (new fromCenter file → 50-animal sortable table, status "Found candidate parents for 50 animal(s)…", CSV downloaded as `potential_parents_2026-06-15.csv`). Existing tabs intact.
- **New shipped data:** `inst/extdata/rhesusPedigree_fromCenter.csv` (`rhesusPedigree` + `fromCenter=TRUE`, 375 animals, unknown parents as **literal `NA`**) — a purpose-built clean fixture, because every shipped pedigree example is a deliberate input-error QC fixture and none reaches the feature's happy path. Owner chose the `rhesusPedigree` source via `AskUserQuestion`.
- **Defect caught by the click-through (FM #24):** the first staged file wrote unknowns as **empty cells**; the app's reader (`read.table` default `na.strings="NA"`, `modInput.R:274`) reads `""` as the empty string, so `""` landed in both the sire and dam columns → `correctParentSex.R:71` *"both sire and dam"* error. My headless pre-check had used `na.strings=c("","NA")`, masking it. Rewrote with literal `NA` and re-verified against the app's exact reader → clean + 50 candidates.
- **Diagnosed non-defects firsthand:** the *"fromCenter → fromcenter"* case-change warning is cosmetic (`fixColumnNames.R:20` lowercases all headers, `:61` restores `fromCenter`; the cleaned studbook keeps `fromCenter`); *"No data available in table"* = the empty Errors-tab placeholder.
- **GitHub:** **#48 CLOSED** (owner-confirmed). Umbrella **#45**'s getPotentialParents line now delivers verified app value. Open issues 18 → 17.
- **PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md:** Learning 79 added (click-through-first + replicate-the-app's-exact-reader).

### 2026-06-15 — Implement #48: wire getPotentialParents into a new Potential Parents tab (Session 80)
- **Deliverable:** Implemented the owner-ratified (S79) `getPotentialParents` Shiny wire-in under **Strict TDD** (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR with phase gates). Turns shipped package-API logic (the S74 #31 gestation-derived dam window) into user-visible app value. The build-from-scratch second session that S79's Learning 77 predicted.
- **TDD phase: full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR**, every transition gated via `AskUserQuestion` (PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN, GREEN→REFACTOR). 0 stakeholder corrections.
- **New code:** `R/modPotentialParents.R` — a pure `flattenPotentialParents()` helper (list-of-lists → render/CSV-ready data.frame, `NULL`/empty → 0-row), `modPotentialParentsUI()` (numeric `maxGestationalPeriod` input default 210, "Find Potential Parents" button, sortable `DT` table, CSV download, graceful empty-state messages), and `modPotentialParentsServer(id, pedigree, minParentAge = 2.0)`.
- **Tests:** `tests/testthat/test_modPotentialParents.R` — 14 tests / 43 expectations covering the helper (cols, NULL/empty, multi-animal flatten, empty-sires, CSV round-trip), the UI (controls + namespace + default 210), and the server via `shiny::testServer` (happy path on the rhesus fixture, no-`fromCenter` empty state, no-unknowns empty state, return shape). All pass.
- **Wiring (2 edits):** `appUI.R` — `tabPanel("Potential Parents", icon("search"), modPotentialParentsUI("potentialParents"))` after Breeding Groups; `appServer.R` — `modPotentialParentsServer("potentialParents", pedigree = reactive(shared$currentPedigree))`.
- **Data seams honored** (from #48): no `fromCenter` column → `getPotentialParents` returns `NULL` → empty-state, not error; `minParentAge` reuses the QC 2-year default as a server param (owner ratified only the gestation UI input, so no second UI input added — scope held); empty results → empty-state message.
- **Verification:** `devtools::check()` clean (0 errors / 0 warnings / 0 notes); full clean-regression read 0 real failed/error; `lintr` clean on the new module + test files; docs regenerated (`modPotentialParents*` exported, `flattenPotentialParents` kept internal via `@noRd`).
- **Phase-3E runtime smoke test (mandatory, performed):** booted the assembled app headlessly via `shinytest2::AppDriver` (`inst/shinytest/app.R`, `NOT_CRAN=true` to bypass the CRAN guard, dev package installed first). Confirmed: app boots with full server init (incl. the new module), the tab + all four controls mount, default 210 set, navigation works, existing tabs intact, module outputs (`statusMessage`/`resultsTable`/`downloadParents`) register error-free. The only log "errors" are pre-existing `shinyBS is not defined` JS reference errors (app-wide, not from this module).
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** user-facing feature → **also** `NEWS.md` (new "Shiny application" bullet under `1.1.0.9000`), plus this CHANGELOG process entry. #48 remains OPEN pending owner-confirmed close; umbrella #45 unchanged.
- **NEWS source-sync fix (owner-flagged mid-session):** `NEWS.md` is generated from `NEWS.Rmd` (`github_document`), but prior sessions had edited the generated `NEWS.md` directly, leaving `NEWS.Rmd` missing three shipped entries — **NEW-47** (`getDescendantPedigree`), **NEW-48/#44/#38** (`getAutoIdFormat`/`setAutoIdFormat`), **NEW-49/#31** (`getPotentialParents` gestation window). Back-ported all three into `NEWS.Rmd`, added the #48 entry to the source, and regenerated `NEWS.md` via `rmarkdown::render()`; verified `NEWS.md == render(NEWS.Rmd)` (escaping now consistently `\#`). Going forward, edit `NEWS.Rmd` and regenerate — not `NEWS.md` directly.

### 2026-06-14 — Resolve UX forks for the getPotentialParents wire-in; deprioritize ORIP (Session 79)
- **Deliverable:** Resolved the three UX/design forks for the **getPotentialParents wire-in** (the #37 integration of the S74 #31 logic, scoped under umbrella #45) with the owner via `AskUserQuestion`, and recorded the ratified design on a new tracking issue **#48** so a following session can implement under TDD. Design/decisions only — **no code**. Also deprioritized **#47 (ORIP)** per owner direction. Open issues **17 → 18** (one new issue, #48).
- **TDD phase = N/A** (design/decisions; no production code or tests — same classification as S76/S77/S78).
- **Owner decisions (via `AskUserQuestion`, all applied, 0 corrections):** (1) **`maxGestationalPeriod` source** = a **numeric input** prefilled with the rhesus default 210, user-overridable (v1 single-species per #45; species-keyed gestation stays #46); (2) **location** = a **new top-level "Potential Parents" tab** (peer to the 8 existing module tabs); (3) **trigger/output** = a **"Find Potential Parents" button** → sortable table (animal → candidate sires/dams) → **CSV download** (the app's `downloadHandler` idiom).
- **Firsthand grounding (recompute-don't-inherit):** read `getPotentialParents.R` in full (gestation dam window `:83-85`, exclusion `:106`; zero production callers), `appUI.R` (8 mounted module tabs), `appServer.R:104-293` (the `modXxxServer(id, <reactives>)` wiring + `shared$currentPedigree` flow), and the `fromCenter` producers (`convertFromCenter` / `qcStudbook`). Confirmed the data seams for the implementer (`fromCenter`-absent → `NULL`; `minParentAge` has no signature default; empty-results state). Noted #45's body line-map predates S74 and is stale.
- **Deprioritization (#47 ORIP):** the repo had **no priority labels** and no `BACKLOG.md` (Issues are the backlog), so created a `low priority` label and applied it to #47 (owner-directed). ORIP's module already exists — a **mount-only** wire-in, correctly deferred behind the larger **build-from-scratch** #48 (→ Learning 77).
- **New issue:** **#48** "Wire in getPotentialParents — new Shiny surface for animals with unknown parents" (`enhancement`) — captures the three ratified forks, the from-scratch module/test/wiring task, the data seams, the #28/#46 out-of-scope boundary, and the mandatory Phase-3E smoke test; references #37/#45.
- **Issue tracker:** #48 filed; register-ratified **link comment** on umbrella **#45** (additive — prior comments preserved, FM #22). Nothing closed; #45 stays OPEN. Verified: #48 OPEN, #45 OPEN (3 comments), #47 labeled `low priority`, open count 18.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** CHANGELOG only — resolving design forks + filing an issue is dev-process history, not a user-facing release note (no `NEWS.md` entry); no `BACKLOG.md` file (open work lives in GitHub Issues).

### 2026-06-14 — Triage #37: wire-in / keep / retire the unused exports (Session 78)
- **Deliverable:** Triaged GitHub issue **#37** ("Exported functions not currently used by app") — a firsthand, clustered disposition of every exported-but-app-unreachable function as **wire-in / keep-as-public-API / retire**, recorded as an [additive triage comment](https://github.com/rmsharp/nprcgenekeepr/issues/37#issuecomment-4703983124). Grooming/triage only — **no code**. #37 stays **OPEN** (the standing inventory). One new issue filed (#47). Open issues **16 → 17**.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (grooming/triage; no production code or tests — same classification as S73/S76/S77).
- **Recompute-don't-inherit:** re-ran the issue's own documented method firsthand (call-graph reachability seeded at `runModularApp`/`runGeneKeepR`/`appUI`/`appServer`, transitive closure of `codetools::findGlobals`). **The S65 (2026-06-12) snapshot had drifted:** now **158 exports / 119 reached / 39 unused** (was 155/116/39); `setAutoIdFormat` (S71 #44/#38) is a new unused export the issue body predates; `chooseDate` is no longer unused. Reachability confirmed clean (no S3/`do.call`/`match.fun`/`get()` path reaches any of the 39).
- **Method:** a Workflow (`wf_be838846-794`) — **9 parallel cluster investigators** (each gathering firsthand: definition, roxygen/`@examples`, tests, vignette/`inst` use, non-app package callers, git provenance, related issue) + an adversarial **completeness critic**. The critic earned its keep (→ **Learning 76**): it (1) **overturned a fabricated caller-edge** — `calcFE`/`calcFG` were claimed "called by `calcFEFG`" but have **no live callers** (`calcFEFG` computes via `calcFounderContributions`+`calcRetention`; `reportGV` calls `calcFEFG`); (2) surfaced two **closed islands** (obfuscation trio rooted at `obfuscatePed`; logging/error/export trio `logModuleEvent`←`safeExecute`/`savePlotToFile`, reachable from nothing live) whose dispositions are coupled; (3) downgraded the investigators' uniform "high-confidence wire-in" on the infra island to a genuine owner-decision; (4) corrected the cluster's roadmap issue (#8 is CLOSED; **#10** is the open sim-kinship home). Every load-bearing critic claim re-verified firsthand against the working tree before recording.
- **Result: 2 wire-in · 37 keep-as-public-API · 0 retire.** "Exported but app-unreachable" is not "dead code" — the package deliberately exposes script/interactive API, so the default is **keep-as-public-API** and nothing reached the breaking-change retire bar.
- **Owner decisions (via `AskUserQuestion`, applied):** (1) **ORIP reporting module** (`modORIPReportingUI`+`modORIPReportingServer`, a complete-but-never-mounted module) → **wire-in** as a grant-reporting tab (filed as **#47**); (2) **logging/error/plot-export island** → **keep as-is / defer** (adopt incrementally; `safeExecute`, zero callers, is a future-cleanup retire candidate); (3) **founder/genetic summary table helpers** (`makeFounderStatsTable`/`makeGeneticSummaryTable`) → **keep-as-public-API** (the app already renders founder stats inline at `modSummaryStats.R:583-638`; wiring in = DRY refactor of working code, no functional gain). The other wire-in — **`getPotentialParents`** — is the S74 #31 feature already homed under umbrella **#45** (#37 wiring gates its app value).
- **Docfixes surfaced (not done — separate session):** `getPedDirectRelatives` `@examples` (`R/getPedDirectRelatives.R:27`) calls `getLkDirectRelatives`, not itself; optional dedicated tests for `kinshipMatrixToKValues` and `getAncestors` (currently transitive-only).
- **New issue:** **#47** "Wire in the ORIP reporting module (mount modORIPReporting* in appUI/appServer)" (`enhancement`) — captures the owner-ratified wire-in; references #37.
- **Issue tracker:** triage posted as an **additive comment** on #37 (the owner's S65 re-verification body/comment preserved — FM #22); #47 filed. Nothing closed; #37 remains OPEN. Verified: #37 OPEN (2 comments), #47 OPEN, open count 17.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** CHANGELOG only — a triage recorded on an issue + filing an issue is dev-process history, not a user-facing release note (no `NEWS.md` entry); no `BACKLOG.md` file (open work lives in GitHub Issues).

### 2026-06-14 — Ratify #28 open-decisions register (Session 77)
- **Deliverable:** Ratified the **8 `[OPEN]` items** in #28's §13 open-decisions register (the S76 colocation data-model spec) via owner sign-off, and recorded the decisions back onto **#28** ([ratification comment](https://github.com/rmsharp/nprcgenekeepr/issues/28#issuecomment-4703716881)) — every item moves **[OPEN] → [DECIDED]**. Design/grooming only — **no code**. #28 stays **OPEN** (the register clears the *design/semantics* gate; implementation remains gated on #11/#12/#37/#46). Open issues **15 → 16** (one new issue filed — #46, below).
- **TDD phase = N/A** (design/grooming; no production code or tests — same classification as S73/S76).
- **Method:** a verify-and-sharpen Workflow (`wf_b8035a53-5be`) — **8 parallel item-verifiers** (one per register item, each re-reading the spec's code claims firsthand against the working tree and adversarially stress-testing its `[REC]`) + an adversarial **completeness critic**. The critic reduced an over-asked 8-item register to **4 genuine owner-decisions** (items 1/2/3 + item 6's provenance half), with the rest as ratifiable corollaries/deferrals; it also surfaced two §7 policy gaps absent from §13. Decisions posed via `AskUserQuestion` (2 rounds, staggered so item 2 could be informed by item 1's answer); rubber-stamps folded into one batch ratification.
- **Owner decisions (all ratified as recommended):** (1) **missing-dam inference** = mother–infant co-housing model with a required, no-default, species-tunable `postnatalCoHousingWindow` + gestation-presence, strictly **soft-rank** (hard-filter rejected); (2) **both-unknown** = **dam-side only** via the focal-animal anchor (soft-rank), sire side unranked; (3) **output** = additive-only invariant locked, concrete carrier deferred to implementation; (4) **coherent obfuscation** = one shared per-animal delta + alias FK-remap, built with #28; (5) **v1 single-species**, #28 does not block on first-class species; (6) **provenance** = stamp pull-date + source id (full bitemporal deferred); (7+8) **defer flat-file ingestion & POSIXct** (LabKey-only, Date resolution) pending a concrete source; **§7 QC policy** = open-start contributes no overlap, contradictory rows raise a QC warning.
- **Two firsthand corrections to the S76 spec** (caught by the verification workflow): **(a)** item 2's written `[REC]` ("require ≥1 known parent — case 3 is anchorless") is **unsound** — `getPotentialParents.R:46-48`'s inclusive-OR filter means a both-unknown infant's *own* birth-time location is a valid **dam-side** anchor (only the sire side is anchorless); so the decision flips to dam-side colocation. **(b)** §10 **mis-cited #36** as the "make species first-class" prerequisite — #36 is actually the chimpanzee age-pyramid *display* ticket; first-class species support was un-ticketed and is now **#46**.
- **Sizing notes recorded for the eventual #28 implementer:** `postnatalCoHousingWindow` is a NEW required, species-dependent parameter (no default, mirrors `maxGestationalPeriod`); `obfuscateDate.R:49-57`'s per-element re-draw-to-floor must be reworked into a per-animal draw (changes existing obfuscation output, breaks current `obfuscatePed`/`obfuscateDate` test expectations); the scored-output carrier/columns are deferred until #37's app consumer + items 1/2 are concrete.
- **New issue:** **#46** "Make species a first-class attribute (ingestion + species-keyed gestation/postnatal window)" (`enhancement`) — the real multi-species dependency, distinct from #36's display scope; owns the corrected §10 dependency.
- **Issue tracker:** ratification posted as an **additive comment** on #28 (S76 spec body/comments preserved — FM #22); register-ratified link comment on **#45**; **#46** filed. Nothing closed; #45/#28 remain OPEN. Verified: #28 OPEN (3 comments), #45 OPEN (2 comments), #46 OPEN, open count 16.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** CHANGELOG only — ratifying a register on an issue + filing an issue is dev-process history, not a user-facing release note (no `NEWS.md` entry); no `BACKLOG.md` file (open work lives in GitHub Issues).

### 2026-06-14 — Spec #28: colocation data model (Session 76)
- **Deliverable:** Wrote a colocation data-model spec onto GitHub issue **#28** (the deferred sub-task under umbrella **#45**), satisfying umbrella **acceptance criterion #4** ("#28 has a written data-model spec — grain of colocation; source query — recorded on #28 before any implementation"). Design/grooming only — **no code**. #28 stays **OPEN** (a spec clears the design gate; it does not complete the data-dependent sub-task). Open issues unchanged at **15**.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (design/grooming; no production code or tests — same classification as S73's consolidation).
- **Method:** firsthand subsystem map via a Workflow (5 parallel facet readers — conception primitive / pedigree data-model+ingestion / LabKey-Oracle-ARMS sourcing / existing location+temporal constructs / colocation semantics — + an adversarial completeness critic), then firsthand re-verification of every load-bearing claim before the outward-facing post (Learning 70 / recompute-don't-inherit → new **Learning 74**). Re-read firsthand: `getPotentialParents.R` (full, post-S74), `getPossibleCols`, `getDateColNames`, `getSiteInfo`, `getDemographics`, `obfuscateDate`, `obfuscatePed`, `fixColumnNames`, `qcStudbook` column-handling.
- **Owner decisions (via `AskUserQuestion`, applied):** temporal model = **Date-ranged residency intervals** (day resolution, matching every existing date column); colocation grain = **configurable, finest-available default** (cage/room/enclosure/building); colocation effect = **soft rank with fallback** (never empties an age-eligible set; no-location candidates retained as `colocation-unknown`); v1 scope = **source-agnostic model + optional `location` arg that degrades to byte-identical (`location = NULL`) behavior** — not hard-blocked on #11/#12.
- **Spec content (13 sections + acceptance criteria):** a separate many-rows-per-id location entity `{id, location, grain, start, end}` (exempt from `removeDuplicates`); the interval-overlap-vs-conception-window predicate reusing the existing `maxGestationalPeriod` primitive; ingestion mirroring `getDemographics`/`getSiteInfo` (new `lkLocationColumns`/`mapLocationColumns`/`locationQueryName`); a null/partial-coverage matrix; and the **obfuscation-coherence requirement** (the critic+firsthand finding — `obfuscatePed` jitters each Date column independently ±30 d and covers only the pedigree, which would corrupt overlap math). Carries an **open-decisions register** (missing-dam inference model + postnatal co-housing window — flagged as *invented design awaiting husbandry ratification*, not derived; output reshape coordinated with #37; species/#36 ordering; bitemporal handling; flat-file ingestion) for sign-off before sizing.
- **Honest scope notes recorded on #28:** #11 (Oracle) is demographic-only/unspecified and #12 (ARMS) is an empty stub, so the gating is *nominal* — the spec defines the model source-agnostically; "source query" is satisfied at the idiom level (mirror `getDemographics`), not a concrete query; the JMAC `species` column survives ingestion as a trailing `novelCol` (`qcStudbook.R:281-283`) but is read nowhere.
- **Issue tracker:** spec posted as a **comment** on #28 (additive — owner's body/comment preserved, FM #22); criterion-#4-satisfied link comment on **#45**. Nothing closed; no issue state changed.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** CHANGELOG only — a spec recorded on an issue is dev-process history, not a user-facing release note (no `NEWS.md` entry); no `BACKLOG.md` file (open work lives in GitHub Issues).

### 2026-06-13 — Close #31: gestation-derived dam-exclusion window (Session 75)
- **Deliverable:** Closed GitHub issue **#31** ("Use gestational length instead of hack for dam identification") as completed — the gestation-derived dam-exclusion window shipped in S74 (`0eeee3f6`) and the owner confirmed the close this session. Open issues **16 → 15**. Completes the #31 lifecycle: S73 consolidate (under umbrella #45) → S74 implement → S75 close (one deliverable per session).
- **TDD phase = N/A** (administrative issue-close; no production code — same classification as S69/S72).
- **Firsthand verification before the irreversible close** (per the standing "don't close an OPEN issue without firsthand evidence" rule + Learning 69): mapped the committed tree (`0eeee3f6`) against umbrella #45's acceptance criteria 1–3 (#31's scope) — (1) the dam window is driven by the existing `maxGestationalPeriod` scalar, no parallel param (`getPotentialParents.R:83-85`, signature unchanged); (2) two tests demonstrate dam selection responds to `maxGestationalPeriod` (synthetic-exclusion + the explicitly-named criterion-2 test, `test_getPotentialParents.R:131-190`); (3) the `:92-93` "hack" TODO is resolved, the roxygen documents the dual use + intentional sire/dam asymmetry, and every dropped-dam fixture delta carries a per-delta biological justification. Re-ran the target file (21/21) and the full suite (0 failed / 0 error) firsthand.
- **Close comment** (with `0eeee3f6` pointer): criterion-by-criterion map + honest scope notes — #31's original "add a `gestationalLength` parameter" suggestion was intentionally superseded by the owner's S73 decision to extend the existing `maxGestationalPeriod`; species-specific gestation remains a documented dependency under #45; the function is exported-but-unwired (#37).
- **Issue tracker:** **15 open** (was 16). #31 `state=CLOSED` (verified). Umbrella #45 + sub-task #28 remain OPEN.
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** CHANGELOG only — closing an issue is dev-process history, not a user-facing release note (no `NEWS.md` entry); no `BACKLOG.md` file (open work lives in GitHub Issues).

### 2026-06-13 — Implement #31: gestation-derived dam-exclusion window in getPotentialParents (Session 74)
- **Deliverable:** Replaced the "hack" in `getPotentialParents()` (a fixed ±½-year birth window for excluding candidate dams, flagged with a TODO at `:92-93`) with a principled gestation-derived window driven by the **existing** `maxGestationalPeriod` parameter — the dam side now gets the gestation treatment the sire side already had. Resolves the near-term, low-lift sub-task of umbrella **#45**. `devtools::check()` clean (0/0/0); full suite 0 failed / 0 error.
- **TDD phase = RED→GREEN→REFACTOR(skipped)** — a real TDD code session (first since S71). All three transition gates + a separate pre-RED scope decision posed via `AskUserQuestion`; phase declared atop every response; **0 stakeholder corrections**.
- **The change (one rule):** a female who delivered another offspring within `maxGestationalPeriod` days of the focal birth cannot have gestated the focal animal (a female bears one offspring at a time), so she is excluded as a candidate dam. The `births` window (`getPotentialParents.R`) now uses `pUnknown$birth[i] ± maxGestationalPeriod` instead of `± dYear/2L` (182.5 d).
- **Scope (owner-decided, minimal):** only the `births` exclusion window changed. The sire/dam exit-check asymmetry (`exit ≥ birth − gestation` for sires vs `exit ≥ birth` for dams) is **biologically correct** (sire→conception, dam→birth) and was documented, not changed. The preferential band (`births_plus_minus_one`) was left untouched — analysis proved moving its inner edge is a behavioral no-op (the wider exclusion always removes the overlap region first).
- **Behavior change, verified + justified firsthand (not silently regenerated):** the exact-set fixtures `dams_1` (BRI2MW) drop `0B7XRI` (−193 d) / `PHCADH` (+195 d); `dams_4` (FEEN9W) drop `1SIP4V` (+183 d) / `DMI0QY` (+192 d) / `HV7LZ3` (−192 d) — each delivered another offspring inside the new ±210 d window. No dams added, no fallback triggered, sires unchanged. Backed by two from-first-principles driving tests: a hand-verifiable synthetic-pedigree exclusion test and a differential-responsiveness test (acceptance criterion #2).
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** BOTH — a behavior change to an exported function is user-facing → `NEWS.md` NEW-49; this entry is the dev-process record. #31 left **OPEN** (implemented, check-green; close is a separate owner-confirmed step).

### 2026-06-13 — Consolidate parent-ID cluster #31 + #28 → umbrella #45 (Session 73)
- **Deliverable:** Created umbrella design issue **#45** ("Principled parent identification in getPotentialParents via estimated conception date") consolidating the two open parent-identification issues — **#31** (replace the dam-exclusion "hack" with gestational length) and **#28** (timestamped colocation at birth − gestation). Both kept **OPEN** as distinct, cross-linked sub-tasks — they are **not** duplicates. Open issues **15 → 16**. Analogous to S70's #44 consolidation, but the disposition differs: the research showed #31/#28 are distinct work (a linking umbrella), not duplicates-to-close.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (grooming/design; no production code or tests — same classification as S70).
- **Method:** firsthand subsystem map via a Workflow (4 parallel facet readers — core fn / callers / gestation+location data infra / tests — + an adversarial completeness critic), then firsthand re-verification of every load-bearing claim before the outward-facing create/link (Learning 70 / recompute-don't-inherit). The verification corrected an overstatement (a `species` column DOES exist in some example inputs, just not the canonical fixtures).
- **Key findings (verified firsthand):** the shared primitive (conception date = birth − gestation) is **already half-implemented** as the existing `maxGestationalPeriod` param, applied sire-side only (`getPotentialParents.R:62`); #31 is a bounded in-function refactor (the dam side never got the treatment) while #28 needs a timestamped-colocation data model the package **lacks** (blocked on #11/#12); `getPotentialParents` is experimental + **unwired** (→ #37); #31 is a **behavior change** (the test asserts exact dam/sire sets via `expect_identical`), not a pure refactor.
- **Owner decisions (via `AskUserQuestion`):** linking umbrella with both sub-tasks open; narrow scope (`getPotentialParents` only); reuse/extend the existing `maxGestationalPeriod` (no parallel parameter).
- **[news-vs-changelog]:** CHANGELOG only — issue consolidation is dev-process history, not a user-facing release note (no `NEWS.md` entry); no `BACKLOG.md` file (open work lives in GitHub Issues).

### 2026-06-13 — Close #44 + #38: configurable auto-ID format (Session 72)
- **Deliverable:** Closed GitHub issues **#44** (umbrella) and **#38** (generation sub-task) as completed — the configurable auto-ID feature shipped in S71 (`14c8e84d`) and the owner confirmed the close this session. Open issues **17 → 15**. Completes the #44 lifecycle: S70 consolidate → S71 implement → S72 close (one deliverable per session).
- **TDD phase = N/A** (administrative issue-close; no production code — same classification as S69/S70).
- **Firsthand verification before the irreversible close** (per the standing "don't close an OPEN issue without firsthand evidence" rule + Learning 69): confirmed the committed tree (`14c8e84d`) against **each** of #44's 8 acceptance criteria — exports in `NAMESPACE`, the predicate routing all 7 detection sites + 2 generators, the round-trip tests, the docstring/tooltip updates — and that the full suite + `devtools::check()` passed on exactly that state. Mapped criteria → code in the close comment.
- **Close comments** (with `14c8e84d` pointer): #44 carries the criterion-by-criterion map + the documented known limitation (prefix-only detection still over-matches real prefix-IDs — the owner-approved byte-identical tradeoff); #38 maps `setAutoIdFormat`/`getAutoIdFormat`/`addUIds`-format-param to its asks. `gh issue close --reason completed`.
- **Issue tracker:** **15 open** (was 17). #44/#38 `state=CLOSED` (verified).

### 2026-06-13 — Implement #44/#38: configurable auto-generated unknown-ID format (Session 71)
- **Deliverable:** Implemented umbrella issue **#44** (and its **#38** sub-task) via strict TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR-skipped). The auto-generated placeholder-ID format for unknown parents is now configurable from a single source of truth, default `"U%04d"`, **byte-identical with no configuration**. Executes S70 SUGGESTED-NEXT candidate (1). Owner decisions (via `AskUserQuestion`): **full #44** scope; **prefix-only byte-identical** detection; **case-sensitive** reconciliation.
- **TDD:** first code session since S68. Three phase gates posed via `AskUserQuestion` (PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN, GREEN→REFACTOR-skipped) plus a separate pre-RED scope/approach decision (3 questions). **0 stakeholder corrections.**
- **New code:** `R/autoIdFormat.R` — `getAutoIdFormat()` / `setAutoIdFormat()` (exported, over `getOption("nprcgenekeepr.autoIdFormat", "U%04d")`, mirroring the `.debug`/`.verbose`/`.gva_seed` convention) + internal `getAutoIdPrefix()` and `isGeneratedUnknownId()` (case-sensitive, NA-preserving like the `startsWith`/`stri_sub` it replaces).
- **Threaded through:** `addUIds()` gains a `format =` param and mints via `sprintf(format, …)` (≡ default); `obfuscateId()` mints with `getAutoIdPrefix()` and detects via the predicate; `removeAutoGenIds()` (×3), `modPedigree.R` display filter, and `reportGV()` founder counts all route detection through the single predicate — replacing all 7 detection literals + 2 generators. `removeAutoGenIds()`'s standing "use a function call" TODO is resolved. `qcStudbook()` unchanged (its `addUIds(sb)` picks up the option via the default — smallest blast radius). Out-of-scope conventions (textual `"UNKNOWN"`/`unknown2NA`, `recordStatus`/`getRecordStatusIndex`) deliberately untouched.
- **Tests (TDD):** NEW `tests/testthat/test_autoIdFormat.R` (default/set/validation/predicate/prefix + a non-default-format `"AUTO%05d"` round-trip: configure→generate→detect→remove); NEW `tests/testthat/test_removeAutoGenIds.R` (none existed — default removal + case-sensitivity + non-default prefix); `test_obfuscateId.R:27-32` updated to the case-sensitive contract (lowercase `"u001"` is now a real ID, the **only** existing test that changed — `test_addUIds.R`/`test_qcStudbook.R`/`test_modPedigree.R` pass unchanged = back-compat proof). **Full suite: 0 failed, 0 error, 159 skip** (985 results); the 5 warnings are pre-existing `test_modPyramid.R` baseline. Lint clean under `load_all` (the `options()` setter carries `# nolint: undesirable_function_linter` per the project's `getPyramidPlot.R` precedent — a public permanent setter, not a scoped change).
- **Docs/exports:** `devtools::document()` → `man/getAutoIdFormat.Rd` + `man/setAutoIdFormat.Rd` + NAMESPACE exports; `man/addUIds.Rd`/`man/removeAutoGenIds.Rd` regenerated. **NEWS.md** NEW-48 (user-facing). `modPedigree.R:112` tooltip notes the format is configurable.

### 2026-06-13 — Consolidate the ID cluster into umbrella #44 (Session 70)
- **Deliverable:** Consolidated the three overlapping auto-generated-unknown-ID issues — **#26**, **#32**, **#38** — into one umbrella design issue **#44** (*"Configurable auto-generated unknown-ID format (default `"U%04d"`) — single source of truth for generation + detection"*). Executes S69 SUGGESTED-NEXT candidate (1). Per owner decisions (via `AskUserQuestion`): configurability = **prefix + number format**, default `"U%04d"`; scope = the `"U"`-prefix convention only; **#26 + #32 closed** as duplicates of #44, **#38 kept open** and linked as the concrete generation sub-task. Open issues **18 → 17** (−2 closed, +1 umbrella created).
- **TDD phase = N/A** (grooming/design; no production code or tests — same classification as S57/S61–S67/S69).
- **Firsthand subsystem map (Workflow under ultracode):** 4 parallel facet readers (generation / detection / callers-config / tests) + an adversarial completeness critic. The critic overturned the mappers on two material points: the package has **three** independent unknown/auto-gen conventions (textual `"UNKNOWN"` in `unknown2NA`; the `"U%04d"` prefix with **two** producers — `addUIds.R:47,54` + `obfuscateId.R:38-43` — and **7** case-divergent detection sites with no centralized predicate; and `recordStatus="added"` in `addParents.R` with the already-centralized `getRecordStatusIndex()`), coupled only by ordering in `qcStudbook.R:188→198→199`.
- **Verify-before-publish:** re-read the 8 load-bearing files firsthand (`addUIds`, `removeAutoGenIds`, `addParents`, `getRecordStatusIndex`, `obfuscateId`, `unknown2NA`, the `qcStudbook` ordering, the `modPedigree.R:112` tooltip) before creating #44 / closing #26/#32 — did not publish subagent findings unverified.
- **#44** captures the verified current-state map, a single-source-of-truth design (`getAutoIdFormat()`/`setAutoIdFormat()` per #38 + an internal `isGeneratedUnknownId()` predicate replacing the 8 literals), acceptance criteria (incl. byte-identical back-compat with no config, and a non-default-format round-trip test), the tests that bake in `"U"`, and an explicit **out-of-scope** section for the textual-`"UNKNOWN"` and `recordStatus` conventions.
- **Issue tracker:** **17 open** (was 18). #26/#32 `state=CLOSED` (verified); #38 OPEN with link comment; #44 OPEN, label `enhancement`.

### 2026-06-13 — Close #35: descendants in pedigree filtering (Session 69)
- **Deliverable:** Closed GitHub issue #35 (*"Include descendants in pedigree filtering (ancestors already implemented)"*) as completed — the feature shipped in S68 (`d4320643`) and the owner confirmed the close this session. Open issues **19 → 18**. Completes the #35 lifecycle: S67 re-scope → S68 implement → S69 close (one deliverable per session).
- **TDD phase = N/A** (administrative issue-close; no production code or tests — same classification as S57/S61–S67).
- **Firsthand verification before the irreversible close** (per the standing "don't close an OPEN issue without firsthand evidence" rule): ran the three covering test files — `test_getDescendantPedigree.R`, `test_modPedigree_processing.R`, `test_modPedigree.R` — **all pass**; read the implementation (`R/getDescendantPedigree.R`, the union at `R/modPedigree.R:299-305`, the help text at `:124-126`) and confirmed it satisfies **each** of the issue's re-scoped asks: descendant set unioned with the existing ancestor set; **Option A** strict-lineal (no collaterals); UI label aligned from "only relatives" to "ancestors and descendants".
- **Close comment** posted with a commit pointer (`d4320643`) mapping the shipped code to the issue's acceptance criteria; `gh issue close --reason completed`.
- **Issue tracker:** **18 open** (was 19).

### 2026-06-13 — Implement #35: descendants in pedigree filtering (Session 68)
- **Deliverable:** Implemented GitHub issue #35 (*"Include descendants in pedigree filtering (ancestors already implemented)"*) via strict TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR-skipped). The Pedigree Browser's "Trim pedigree based on focal animals" option now includes both the **ancestors and descendants** of the focal animals (previously ancestors only). Owner chose **Option A — strict lineal** (no collateral relatives). Executes S67 SUGGESTED-NEXT #1.
- **TDD:** first real code session after S57–S67's non-code run. Three phase gates posed via `AskUserQuestion` (PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN, GREEN→REFACTOR) plus a separate pre-RED Option A/B approach decision. **0 stakeholder corrections.**
- **New/changed code:** `R/getDescendantPedigree.R` — new exported transitive-offspring closure, the downward mirror of `getProbandPedigree()`. `R/modPedigree.R:292-307` — trim block now unions the ancestor closure (`trimPedigree`) with the descendant closure: `ped[ped$id %in% union(ancestors$id, descendants$id), ]`. UI help text (`:125`) and module docstring (`:166`) updated from the "only relatives" over-promise to "ancestors and descendants".
- **Tests (TDD):** NEW `tests/testthat/test_getDescendantPedigree.R` (6 unit tests on `lacy1989Ped`: transitive offspring, leaf, multi-proband, empty, absent, circular-terminates); 2 integration tests added to `test_modPedigree_processing.R` (descendants included; strict-lineal excludes sibling + mate). One stale pre-existing test in `test_modPedigree.R` updated to the new contract — surfaced by the full-suite clean-regression read (Learning 68). **Full suite: 972 tests, 0 failed, 0 error, 159 skip.**
- **Docs/exports:** `devtools::document()` → `man/getDescendantPedigree.Rd` + NAMESPACE export; `man/modPedigreeServer.Rd` regenerated. **NEWS.md** NEW-47 entry (user-facing). Lint clean (lone `object_usage_linter` warning proven an install-staleness artifact). Phase 3E: `shiny::testServer(modPedigreeServer, …)` integration tests exercise the changed reactive.
- **Issue tracker:** #35 implemented — to be closed (19 → 18 open) once the owner confirms.

### 2026-06-13 — Re-scope #35 to descendants (ancestor-inclusion verified done) (Session 67)
- **Deliverable:** Re-scoped GitHub issue #35 (was *"Include ancestors and descendants in pedigree filtering"*) to **"Include descendants in pedigree filtering (ancestors already implemented)"** and kept it **open**. Firsthand-verified that ancestor-inclusion is live and descendants are not, rewrote the body to current reality, corrected two stale references, documented two implementation options, and posted a dated verification comment (`#issuecomment-4699260833`). Executes S66 SUGGESTED-NEXT #1.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (issue-grooming; no production code or tests — same classification as S57/S61–S66).
- **What's verified (firsthand):** Ancestors **DONE** — `R/modPedigree.R:292-302`: when the "Trim pedigree" checkbox is on it calls `trimPedigree(probands, ped, …)` → `getProbandPedigree()` (`R/getProbandPedigree.R:24-40`), an upward `sire`/`dam` closure (ancestors only; the module docstring at `:166` already says "ancestors"). Descendants **NOT** implemented — neither function walks downward.
- **Two stale references corrected in the body:** (1) the issue's cited "Current Code" (lines 246-253, a `# TODO: Include ancestors and descendants` placeholder) no longer exists — replaced by the ancestor logic at 292-302; (2) its "Suggested Implementation" called `trimPedigree(…, ancestors = TRUE, descendants = TRUE)` — a signature that **does not exist** (`trimPedigree(probands, ped, removeUninformative, addBackParents)`).
- **Implementation options documented (owner chose "document both"):** (A) strict lineal — add a downward closure mirroring `getProbandPedigree`'s loop (repeated `getOffspring()` to closure) and union with the ancestor set; (B) reuse `getPedDirectRelatives()` (`R/getPedDirectRelatives.R:46-59`), which already loops parents+offspring to closure but also pulls in collateral relatives (sibs/cousins/mates), broadening beyond lineal. Left for the implementation session.
- **Form (owner-chosen via `AskUserQuestion`):** rewrite the body + retitle + dated verification comment; issue kept open.
- **Issue tracker:** 19 open issues (unchanged — #35 updated, not closed).

### 2026-06-13 — Merge methodology PR #25/#27 wording branch into add-methodology (Session 66)
- **Deliverable:** Merged the local out-of-band branch `chore/methodology-pr2527-wording` (one wording-only commit `ce7d6779`) into `add-methodology`, then deleted it. Adopts the merged-upstream methodology PR #25/#27 wording — **no migration** (this repo's learnings extraction was done in Sessions 10/28; it is the reference end-state).
- **TDD phase = N/A** (docs/methodology merge; no `R/`, `tests/`, `man/`, or `NEWS.md` changes — same non-code classification as S57/S61–S65).
- **What landed (4 files, +10/−5):** SESSION_RUNNER.md §3C body → the canonical adopter-vs-canonical learnings-routing text + the Learnings-table caption reworded (3C section now byte-identical to canonical; the 6 seed rows already matched); `docs/methodology/HOW_TO_USE.md` 3C bullet → matching routing text; CLAUDE.md + PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md → replace the empirical "40k-char limit" justification with the documented size-budget language ("Claude Code targets ~200 lines / ~25 KB"); counts and history preserved.
- **Merge mechanics:** true merge commit `0f9728e3` (`--no-ff`; the base had diverged — Sessions 63–65 added commits after the branch point `b7f45901`). Pre-merge `git merge-tree` dry run showed **0** conflict markers; 3 of 4 files were byte-identical to the branch base, and PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md auto-merged **keep-both** (branch's line-3 header rewording + the S63/64/65 tail-appended Learning rows — non-overlapping hunks).
- **Verified:** all 4 task-spec greps pass — "Adopter project" in SESSION_RUNNER.md (3C body + table caption), no "40k" in CLAUDE.md/PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md, one "200 lines" in each, and the HOW_TO_USE.md 3C routing bullet. Branch deleted with safe `git branch -d` (confirmed merged).
- **Build impact:** none — all 4 files are build-ignored (`.Rbuildignore` patterns `^CLAUDE.*\.md$`, `^PROJECT_LEARNINGS.*\.md$`, `^SESSION_RUNNER.*\.md$`, `^docs$`), verified firsthand; `R CMD check` unaffected.
- **Issue tracker:** 19 open issues (unchanged — no issue activity this session).

### 2026-06-12 — Update #37 (exported-functions-unused inventory: 45 of 70 now used) (Session 65)
- **Deliverable:** Updated GitHub issue #37 ("Exported functions not currently used by app") to current reality and **kept it open**. Struck the **45 of 70** listed functions now reached by the app, kept the 22 still-unused + 3 S3 methods, corrected the totals (**116 / 155 used, 39 unused**; was 38 / 108 / 70), fixed the 5 "Notable findings", added a dated re-verification note, and folded in the **17 unused exports created since** the issue was filed (2026-01-25). Executes S64 SUGGESTED-NEXT #1.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (issue-grooming; no production code or tests written — same classification as S57/S61/S62/S63/S64).
- **Method (firsthand, reproducible):** app reachability by call-graph closure — `pkgload::load_all`, seed at `{runModularApp, runGeneKeepR, appUI, appServer}`, transitive closure of `codetools::findGlobals` over package functions; exported names outside the closure are "unused." Concrete call paths were produced for the flipped set (e.g. `rankSubjects` via `appServer → modGeneticValueServer → reportGV → orderReport`; the 4 Shiny modules called directly by `appServer`; the genotype trio via `modInputServer`; `filterKinMatrix/Report/Threshold` via the breeding-group + GV modules).
- **Adversarial check of the static method's blind spots:** the only string-dispatched call in `R/` is `do.call("rbind", …)`, and none of the 22 still-unused names appear as string literals → no dynamic-dispatch invocation the closure missed; the S3 methods aren't dispatched on the app path (the app's `summary()` calls hit `summary.default` on numeric vectors).
- **Re-grade vs the handoff:** S64 (inheriting the S62 audit) framed #37 as "strike the resolved Shiny-module + genotype rows; keep the still-accurate inventory" — implying ≈7 functions flipped and the bulk held. Firsthand recomputation found **45/70 flipped** — ~64% stale, not 2 clusters. Same classifier-stops-at-the-headline calibration miss documented for S62→#14 and S63→#8.
- **Applied form (owner-chosen via `AskUserQuestion`):** strikethrough-in-place + dated verification note in the body (`gh issue edit 37 --body-file`), plus the 17 newer unused exports; a timeline pointer comment (`#issuecomment-4696756359`) makes the correction visible to watchers. Issue kept **open** — the 39 genuinely-unused exports remain the actionable surface (largest clusters: the simulated-kinship subsystem and the ORIP reporting module).
- **Issue tracker:** 19 open issues (unchanged — #37 updated, not closed).

### 2026-06-12 — Verify + close #8 (non-founder no-parents handling — caveated close) (Session 64)
- **Deliverable:** Closed GitHub issue #8 ("Improve handling of non-founder animals without either parents assigned") as **implemented**, with a strengthened-caveat resolution comment. Executes S63 SUGGESTED-NEXT #1 (the other STALE candidate from the S62 audit) — but firsthand verification + a reproduction re-graded it from the audit's footnote-caveat to a **strengthened caveat with a reproduced silent-failure case**.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (verify-and-close; no production code or tests written — same classification as S57/S61/S63).
- **What's implemented (verified firsthand):** both of the issue's proposed solutions are live in the GVA report-ordering path. Solution 1 (origin/"From Center" segregation) — ONPRC-born founders with no offspring are split into a `noParentage` bucket (`R/orderReport.R:31,44-54`). Solution 2 (don't rank them) — those animals get `value = "Undetermined"`, `rank = NA` (`R/rankSubjects.R:38,44`). Live wiring: `reportGV()` → `orderReport(finalData, ped)` (`R/reportGV.R:146`). Tests green against source via `pkgload::load_all`: `test_orderReport.R` 8/0/0/0, `test_rankSubjects.R` 5/0/0/0.
- **The caveats (firsthand, beyond the audit's note):** (1) **The fix is gated on the optional `origin` column and silently does nothing without it.** The whole `noParentage` block is wrapped in `if ("origin" %in% names(rpt))` (`R/orderReport.R:31`); `origin` reaches the report only when the source pedigree carries it (`R/reportGV.R:119` `intersect(getIncludeColumns(), names(ped))`) and is documented optional. **Reproduced:** a no-parent founder with no offspring → `value = "High Value", rank = 1` (the original bug) without `origin`, vs `"Undetermined"/NA` with it — no warning when the safeguard doesn't apply. (2) **No regression test pins the `Undetermined`/`rank = NA` branch** — `test_orderReport` exercises the path but asserts only positional unknown-ID counts; `test_rankSubjects` never exercises `noParentage`. (3) **The 2021 simulated-kinship subsystem is orphaned** — `getPotentialParents`, `createSimKinships`, `kinshipMatricesToKValues`, `summarizeKinshipValues`, `countKinshipValues`, `addKinshipValueCount`, `cumulateSimKinships` are exported but have no live caller in `R/` (present only in tests, `inst/extdata/trulyUnknownParents.R`, `vignettes/simulatedKValues.Rmd`); the issue's "discuss with Matt" design item is unresolved. These remaining items are recorded in the close comment as candidate enhancements but **not filed** (new-issue creation outside the approved "close with caveat" scope — S63 lesson).
- **Method (right-sized under ultracode):** firsthand source read + a direct **reproduction** of the origin-gating failure + `load_all` test runs + a 3-lens adversarial refute-the-close workflow (`wf_f37f1b72-b6a`). The gate split 1 hold-open / 2 close-with-caveat; the hold-open verdict (origin-gating makes the fix illusory in the common case) was reconciled firsthand via the reproduction, which upgraded the caveat and was surfaced to the owner via `AskUserQuestion` before the irreversible close.
- **Issue tracker:** 19 open issues remain (was 20).

### 2026-06-12 — Verify + close #14 (genotype provide+track — caveated close) (Session 63)
- **Deliverable:** Closed GitHub issue #14 ("Add ability to provide genotypes for animals within the pedigree and track them") as **implemented**, with a caveat resolution comment. Executes S62 audit recommendation #1 — but firsthand verification re-graded it from the audit's "clean" classification to **close-with-caveat**.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (verify-and-close; no production code or tests written — same classification as S57/S61).
- **Verified firsthand:** the genotype provide+track ability is live-wired and test-pinned. `getGenotypes`/`checkGenotypeFile`/`addGenotype` read + integer-code + merge in the modular app's separate-genotype-file mode (`R/modInput.R:384-396`); the integer `first`/`second` columns ride the cleaned studbook into `reportGV()` → `getGVGenotype` (`R/reportGV.R:78`) → `geneDrop(genotype=…)` (`:92`) → `calcGU`/`calcFG`; the functions are exported for scripting; **278 genotype-path assertions pass (0 fail / 0 err / 0 skip)**, including the end-to-end `modInputServer` separate-file test (`tests/testthat/test_modInput_qcStudbook.R:536-545`). Live entry point: `runModularApp()` → `shinyApp(appUI(), appServer)` → `modInputUI/Server("dataInput")`.
- **The caveat (deliberate, owner-authored):** the combined-file UI mode (`commonPedGenoFile`) does **not** integer-code string alleles, so genotypes supplied in a single combined file don't reach gene-drop — at parity with the legacy monolith (per commit `c9019d51`'s own rationale). Documented in the close comment; extending tracking to the combined-file mode is noted there as a candidate future enhancement (not filed — new-issue creation was outside the approved scope).
- **Method (right-sized under ultracode):** firsthand source read + `pkgload::load_all` test run + a 3-lens adversarial refute-the-close workflow (`wf_9d00a37a-6d0`). The refute pass earned its keep: the intent-completeness lens surfaced the combined-file caveat that re-graded the close, and a test-authenticity "tests are failing" refutation was correctly traced to a **stale installed binary** (the source tests pass green) rather than a real regression.
- **Issue tracker:** 20 open issues remain (was 21).

### 2026-06-12 — Backlog-staleness audit of all 21 open GitHub issues (Session 62)
- **Deliverable:** `docs/audits/BACKLOG_STALENESS_AUDIT_2026-06-12.md` — a read-only audit classifying every open issue as **STALE** (already implemented), **PARTIAL**, or **OPEN** against the current code, motivated by S61's finding that #34 was resolved in code but stayed open. Generalizes that one-issue check to the whole tracker. **No code, tests, or issues changed** (closing is a recommended follow-up, not executed — 1-and-done).
- **TDD phase = N/A** (read-only audit; no production code or tests written — same classification as the S57/S61 non-code sessions).
- **Result:** **2 STALE / close candidates** (#14 genotype provide+track — clean close, #34-grade; #8 non-founder no-parents handling — close *with caveat*: both proposed solutions are live but gated on the optional `origin` column and lack a direct test assertion); **5 PARTIAL** (#1, #5, #9, #35, #37 — keep open with narrowed scope; #37 should be *updated*, not closed); **14 genuinely OPEN** (#2, #4, #10, #11, #12, #13, #26, #28, #29, #31, #32, #33, #36, #38 — cited TODOs still present verbatim or no implementation exists).
- **Method:** 24-agent classify→adversarial-verify workflow (one classifier per issue, searching by *content* not stale line numbers; every STALE call handed to an independent skeptic told to refute it). The adversarial pass **knocked down a false-STALE on #1** — its `Clear Focal Animals` checkbox clears the IDs reactive but not the file-browser input, exactly as the owner's own 2020 GitHub comment notes — and downgraded #8 to a caveated close. All close-relevant calls (#14, #8, #1) were re-verified firsthand by the session against source + `gh api`.
- **Structural findings:** the issue tracker lags the code only in the resolved→still-open direction (no false "open"); the auto-generated-ID cluster (#38/#32/#26 + dam-ID #31) is one feature split across four issues — recommend consolidating; the old external-system requests (#10/#11/#12/#13/#28) are correctly open and large. Report placed under `docs/audits/` (build-ignored via `^docs$`) so it does not regress S60's top-level-files-NOTE elimination.

### 2026-06-12 — Verify and close issue #34 (`qcStudbook` already integrated in `modInput`) (Session 61)
- **Closed issue #34** ("Integrate qcStudbook() in modInput Shiny module", bug/high). The placeholder QC logic the issue describes (`# TODO: Replace with actual qcStudbook() call` + `results$cleaned <- rawData`) was already replaced by a real `qcStudbook()`/`runQcStudbook()` integration during the Shiny-module conversion (commit `7da01afe`, extended `c9019d51`/`bb7f2be6`); CHANGELOG's Session-20 entry already noted #34 as "stale (already integrated)" but the GitHub issue was never formally closed. This session verified the resolution firsthand and closed it with a resolution comment. **No code changed.**
- **TDD phase = N/A** (verify-and-close; no production code or tests written — same classification as the S57 close of #30).
- **What's wired:** `R/modInput.R:408` calls `qcStudbook(rawData, minParentAge, reportChanges=TRUE, reportErrors=TRUE)`; `:423` calls the two-pass wrapper `runQcStudbook()` (`R/runQcStudbook.R`); `R/processQcStudbookResult.R` shapes results for the UI; `minParentAge` is read from the UI input with safe coercion (`:398-404`); live path confirmed `appUI.R:123` (`modInputUI("dataInput")`) → `appServer.R:104` (`modInputServer`).
- **Verification (firsthand):** `test_qcStudbook.R` 38/0/0/0 + `test_modInput_qcStudbook.R` 90/0/0/0 (pass/fail/err/skip). The `shiny::testServer` module tests ran (**0 skips**; `shiny` installed), driving `modInputServer` and asserting the cleaned studbook carries the `gen` column that only `qcStudbook()` adds (`test_modInput_qcStudbook.R:296`) — that assertion would FAIL if the module were reverted to the placeholder, so the integration is regression-pinned. A 3-lens adversarial refute-the-close workflow (residual-placeholder/live-path ‖ functional-completeness ‖ test-authenticity) returned refuted=false / high confidence / 0 gaps on all three lenses.

### 2026-06-12 — `.Rbuildignore` excludes all non-shipping top-level dev/audit files — "non-standard top-level files" NOTE eliminated (Session 60)
- **Deliverable:** added `.Rbuildignore` patterns for the 8 currently-shipping non-standard top-level files so they are dropped from the build tarball, **eliminating** the R CMD check "non-standard files/directories found at top level" NOTE entirely — the built tarball's top level is now only the 5 standard files (`DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, `NEWS.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`). Excluded: `20250504_cran-comments.md` (the 8th dated cran-comments file — its 7 siblings were already individually ignored), `methodology_dashboard.py`, `dashboard.html`, `nprcgenekeepr_notes.txt`, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`, `PED_GV_AUDIT_2026-05-30.{md,html}`, `TECH_DEBT_AUDIT_2026-05-30.md`. This is the deferred "scope-B" follow-up S58/S59 surfaced (a tarball-contents change, distinct from the pure dupe-guards of S58/S59).
- **Owner decisions (`AskUserQuestion`):** (1) scope = exclude **all 8** (none are package content) → eliminate the NOTE; (2) style = broad dupe-guarded + consolidate — the 7 dated `^YYYYMMDD_cran-comments\.md$` exact lines replaced by one `^[0-9]+_cran-comments\.md$` regex (covers 20250504 + any future dated file, so a new one never silently ships again), and the synced methodology/audit files use `<NAME>.*` forms (`^RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.*\.md$`, `^PED_GV_AUDIT.*`, `^TECH_DEBT_AUDIT.*`) that also catch macOS sync dupes; the non-synced files (`methodology_dashboard.py`, `dashboard.html`, `nprcgenekeepr_notes.txt`) use tight exact-match.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (build-config only; `.Rbuildignore` is dropped from the built tarball → no shippable `testthat` assertion; same rationale as S58/S59).
- **Verification (firsthand, authoritative at the build level):** staged 3 real spaced dupes (`RECOMMENDED_SKILLS 2.md`, `PED_GV_AUDIT_2026-05-30 2.md`, `TECH_DEBT_AUDIT_2026-05-30 2.md`), ran `R CMD build --no-build-vignettes --no-manual .` (RC=0 → no regex-comment abort); the resulting tarball's top level contained **exactly** the 5 standard files — none of the 8 excluded files and none of the 3 staged dupes (685 files, down from the 693-file baseline = the 8 removed). The "non-standard top-level files" NOTE is a pure function of the tarball's top-level entries, so this directly confirms the NOTE is gone (full `devtools::check()` not re-run — nothing affecting tests/examples/metadata changed; consistent with S58/S59). The complete 8-file set was enumerated by building the baseline tarball first (S59's candidate list named only 4 of the 8). Temp dupes + tarballs removed via `trap cleanup`; tree clean.

### 2026-06-12 — `.Rbuildignore` macOS-dupe guard generalized to the whole methodology `.md` cluster (Session 59)
- **Deliverable:** generalized Session 58's SESSION_NOTES dupe-guard to the rest of the top-level methodology/doc `.md` files. Broadened 7 exact-match `.Rbuildignore` patterns to the `<NAME>.*\.md$` form — `PROJECT_LEARNINGS`, `CLAUDE`, `SESSION_RUNNER`, `SAFEGUARDS`, `BACKLOG`, `ROADMAP`, `CHANGELOG` (`.Rbuildignore:78-85`) — so macOS file-sync duplicates (`CLAUDE 2.md`, `CHANGELOG copy.md`, …) of any of them are build-ignored and can never re-raise the R CMD check "non-portable file names" WARNING. After S58 only `SESSION_NOTES` was `.*`-guarded; this kills the dupe-WARNING class for the whole methodology cluster. (Owner decisions via `AskUserQuestion`: loose `.*` style to match the S58 line; scope limited to the already-ignored cluster — adding currently-unignored docs such as `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` deferred as a separate tarball-contents change.)
- **TDD phase = N/A** (build-config only; same rationale as S58 — `.Rbuildignore` is dropped from the built tarball, so there is no shippable `testthat` assertion).
- **Verification (firsthand, both levels):** (1) regex probe across all 7 names — OLD exact patterns miss every dupe form (the leak); NEW `.*` form matches `<NAME> 2.md` and `<NAME> copy.md` while NOT over-matching `<NAME>.Rmd` / `<NAME>_archive.txt`, and canonical names stay excluded. (2) build-equivalent (authoritative) — staged 14 real spaced dupes (both forms × 7 names), ran `R CMD build --no-build-vignettes --no-manual` (RC=0); the resulting tarball (693 files) contained **zero** of the 7 names as `.md` → all dupes + canonicals excluded, real content (DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE) present. Temp files + tarball removed via `trap cleanup`; tree clean.
- **In-flight finding (caught by the build step, not shipped):** `.Rbuildignore` lines are *all* perl regexes — including `#` comment lines (they simply match no real path). An initial multi-line comment with an unbalanced `(` made `R CMD build` abort with `invalid regular expression`; fixed to regex-safe comment lines, plus an inline NOTE warning future editors. (See PROJECT_LEARNINGS Learning 59.)

### 2026-06-12 — `.Rbuildignore` permanent macOS-dupe fix (Session 58)
- **Deliverable:** broadened `.Rbuildignore`'s `^SESSION_NOTES\.md$` → `^SESSION_NOTES.*\.md$` so macOS file-sync duplicates (`SESSION_NOTES 2.md`, `SESSION_NOTES 3.md`, `SESSION_NOTES copy.md`, …) are build-ignored and can never again re-enter the build tarball to re-raise the R CMD check "non-portable file names" WARNING that Session 57 had to clear by hand. This is the permanent fix S57 deferred (root cause: an exact-match build-ignore pattern doesn't cover the space-name); the prior `^\.Rhistory\ 2$` entry shows the same class was patched narrowly once before.
- **TDD phase = N/A** (build-config only; no R code, no shippable unit test — `.Rbuildignore` is dropped from the built tarball, so a `testthat` assertion on it can't run under R CMD check).
- **Verification (firsthand):** (1) regex probe — OLD pattern matches `SESSION_NOTES.md` only; NEW matches all dupe variants and over-matches nothing (`CHANGELOG.md`, `SESSION_NOTES_archive.txt` stay excluded; canonical `SESSION_NOTES.md` still excluded). (2) build-equivalent — staged a real `SESSION_NOTES 2.md`, ran `R CMD build` (RC=0); the resulting tarball contained **zero** SESSION_NOTES entries → the dupe is excluded and the WARNING cannot fire. Temp file + tarball removed; tree clean. (Full `devtools::check()` intentionally skipped — the WARNING is a pure function of tarball contents, verified directly.)

### 2026-06-12 — Close issue #30 + repo hygiene (Session 57)
- **Closed issue #30** ("work on use of lintr until satisfied with code style"). The plan deliverable (`docs/planning/issue30-lintr-exclusion-cleanup-plan.md`) is complete: `lintr::lint_package()` = **0** (re-verified firsthand this session), every `R/`-file `.lintr` line-specific exclusion removed except the deliberately-kept `makeGeneticDiversityDashboard` (author won't-delete, `.Rbuildignore`'d). The CI `lint` check is GREEN. Closed with a resolution comment summarizing Phases 1–4 (Sessions 53–56). Optional trivial follow-up noted on the issue: convert the lone remaining range-exclusion to an inline `# nolint start/end` block (plan §4C #16).
- **Repo hygiene:** removed the untracked macOS-duplicate `SESSION_NOTES 2.md` (563 KB, never committed, content fully contained in `SESSION_NOTES.md`). Its space-in-filename was the sole cause of the `devtools::check()` "portable file names" **WARNING** (`.Rbuildignore`'s `^SESSION_NOTES\.md$` exact-match does not cover the space-name, so the dupe entered the build tarball). **Verified firsthand:** post-removal `devtools::check()` = **0 errors / 0 warnings / 3 NOTEs** (was 1 WARNING at S56) → the WARNING is cleared. The 3 residual NOTEs are all pre-existing/environmental (clock-skew future-timestamps, spelling, and "non-standard top-level files" — the latter now lists only no-space methodology/audit files: `20250504_cran-comments.md`, `PED_GV_AUDIT_2026-05-30.{html,md}`, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`, `TECH_DEBT_AUDIT_2026-05-30.md`, `dashboard.html`, `methodology_dashboard.py`, `nprcgenekeepr_notes.txt`; the build-ignored `..Rcheck/` does not appear).

### 2026-06-12 — Issue #30 Phase 4: behavior-sensitive lint refactors + de-exclude (Session 56)
- **Deliverable:** implemented Phase 4 (the final exclusion-cleanup phase) of the issue #30 plan — the **6 behavior-sensitive `.lintr` line-exclusions** (5 §4B + the reclassified `checkRequiredCols`). After this, the **only** `R/`-file line exclusion left is `makeGeneticDiversityDashboard` (deliberately kept); `lintr::lint_package()` stays **0**.
- **`checkRequiredCols.R` (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR, commit `17e3fa06`):** `as.character(unlist(sapply(...)))` → `requiredCols[!requiredCols %in% cols]`. Owner-chosen robust contract: on out-of-contract `NA`-in-`cols` (reportErrors=TRUE) it now returns the missing cols cleanly instead of erroring (`"missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed"`); non-NA output byte-identical, `reportErrors=FALSE` untouched. Pinned by a RED NA-contract test; `@details` documents it.
- **4 behavior-none REFACTORs (commit `69c8d759`, all adversarially verified):** `correctParentSex.R` (if/else inverted to a guard clause; 6000-iter fuzz identical incl. error messages); `fillGroupMembersWithSexRatio.R` (`else { if }` → `else if`, inline `# nolint` deleted; 146 seeded cases identical); `setExit.R` (`mapply` → `unlist(Map(...))`, `chooseDate` always length-1; 21 inputs identical).
- **`addSexAndAgeToGroup.R` (adopted-robust REFACTOR, commit `69c8d759`):** `sapply` → `ped$sex[match(ids, ped$id)]`. Adversarial verification found that on **empty `ids`** the old `sapply` form dropped the `sex` column (2-col result), which **crashed** the one caller (`modBreedingGroups.R:438` `colnames(gp) <- c(<3 names>)`) on an empty group; the `match()` form returns the documented 3-column schema (sex an empty factor) and renders an empty table. Owner adopted the new behavior as intentional; pinned by an empty-ids contract test + a happy-path characterization test; `@details` documents it.
- **`create_wkbk.R` (accepted-divergence REFACTOR, commit `69c8d759`):** inner `if (replace)` → guard clause `if (!replace)`. Owner-accepted cosmetic divergence: on a non-logical non-coercible `replace` while the file exists, both versions error but the message text differs (`"argument is not interpretable as logical"` → `"invalid argument type"`); `replace` is documented logical, coercible values identical.
- **Verification:** `lint_package()` = 0; the 6 files lint-clean (`parse_settings=FALSE`); full suite **0 fail / 0 err / 159 skip** (S49 baseline + 5 new passing expectations from the contract/characterization tests → zero regression); `devtools::check()` **0 errors** (1 pre-existing-environmental WARNING + 2 NOTEs from stray top-level files incl. the macOS `SESSION_NOTES 2.md` dupe — not from this change); adversarial behavior-verification workflow `wf_168f8dcf-1e5` (6 skeptics, each told to refute). Phase-3E: `addSexAndAgeToGroup`'s runtime integration is covered by `test_modBreedingGroups.R:1015-1122` (the breeding-groups member view), green in the full suite.

### 2026-06-11 — Issue #30 Phase 3: behavior-none lint refactors + `.lintr` casing fix (Session 55)
- **Deliverable:** implemented Phase 3 of the issue #30 plan — **6 behavior-none lint refactors**, each removing its `.lintr` line-exclusion in the same change ([lint-net-zero]). `lintr::lint_package()` stays **0**.
- **Refactors (all adversarially verified behavior-preserving):** `convertFromCenter.R` + `fillGroupMembers.R` + `hasGenotype.R` (`unnecessary_nesting` collapses — drop an `else` after an unconditional `stop()`/`return()`; `else { if }` → `else if`); `getLkDirectAncestors.R` + `getLkDirectRelatives.R` (rename local var `source` → `msgSource`, which `undesirable_function_linter` flagged as shadowing `base::source`; also dropped 2 now-redundant inline nolints); `saveDataframesAsFiles.R` (`unnecessary_lambda` → `vapply(dfList, inherits, logical(1L), what = "data.frame")`).
- **`.lintr` casing bug fixed** (owner-flagged): `R/CheckRequiredCols.R` → `R/checkRequiredCols.R` — the capital-`C` entry matched nothing on case-sensitive CI, so the L34 lint would fire on the Linux `lint` runner.
- **`checkRequiredCols.R` (planned Phase 3 #1) reclassified to Phase 4:** adversarial verification + firsthand repro proved its `sapply`→`%in%` fix is NOT behavior-none — on out-of-contract `NA`-in-`cols` it turns a thrown error into a clean missing-columns return (exported fn). Owner-approved deferral (`AskUserQuestion`) to a RED→GREEN→REFACTOR slice in Phase 4; the file's code + `.lintr` entry left as-is (casing now correct).
- **Verification:** `lint_package()` = 0; the 6 files lint-clean (`parse_settings=FALSE`); full suite **2140 pass / 0 fail / 0 err / 159 skip** (= S49 baseline → zero regression); `devtools::check()` **0 errors** (1 pre-existing-environmental WARNING + NOTE from stray top-level files incl. a macOS `SESSION_NOTES 2.md` dupe — not from this change); `man/` untouched.

### 2026-06-11 — Implement issue #30: drive the R/ lint check to GREEN (Session 54)
- **Deliverable:** implemented the issue #30 cleanup plan; `lintr::lint_package()` now reports **0 lints** in
  `R/` (was 193 = 41 suppressed by `.lintr` line-excludes + 152 residual) → the CI `lint` check goes green.
- **Phase 1 (commit `74a46d4c`):** removed dead commented code in `getErrorTab.R`, `get_elapsed_time_str.R`,
  `print.summary.nprcgenekeeprErr.R`; stripped a stray `#'` in `set_seed.R` (also fixed a `#'` leak into
  `man/set_seed.Rd`); removed the 4 now-unneeded `.lintr` line exclusions + the dead
  `#commented_code_linter = NULL` no-op; kept `makeGeneticDiversityDashboard` (author won't-delete, NEW-20).
- **Residual (this commit):** fixed the 154 firing lints across 17 `R/` files + `inst/shinytest/app.R` via a
  per-file editor→adversarial-verifier workflow (one editor + one verifier per file; 150+ fixes, all 18 files
  verified behavior-preserved). **Owner decisions (`AskUserQuestion`):** (1) keep `implicit_integer_linter` ON
  and fix all 74 with `L` (counts/indices/widths) or `.0` (reals, e.g. `ped$age * 12.0`) — NOT disable;
  (2) targeted inline `# nolint` for the 16 verified false-positives / justified idioms. Mechanical fixes:
  `line_length` wraps, `brace`, `keyword_quote`, `return`, `paste(collapse=)`→`toString()`, `sapply`→`vapply`,
  `if`/`else if` chain → `switch()` in `logModuleEvent.R`; removed the stale `getPyramidPlot.R = 25:27` exclusion.
- **`# nolint` (verified non-bugs):** `object_usage` ×6 (package-internal `calcFounderContributions`/`gatedSeed`
  lintr can't resolve + `founderStats` which IS a `modSummaryStatsServer` formal), `nonportable_path` ×3
  (MIME strings), `object_name` ×2 (base-R `launch.browser` arg), `library()` ×2 (shinytest harness),
  `par()` ×3 (CRAN save/restore idiom).
- **Verification (firsthand):** `lint_package()` = 0; full test suite **2140 pass / 0 fail / 0 err / 159 skip**
  (S49 baseline held exactly — zero behavior regression); `document()` regenerated 3 man pages (roxygen reflow,
  content identical); **Phase-3E** — booted the app from `load_all` source: all 7 module UI builders constructed
  and `runModularApp` served HTTP 200 / 92 KB.
- Issue #30 remains OPEN pending owner confirmation to close (the `lint` check is now green).

### 2026-06-11 — Plan issue #30: resolve the `.lintr` line-specific exclusions (Session 53)
- **Deliverable (planning):** `docs/planning/issue30-lintr-exclusion-cleanup-plan.md` — an evidence-based plan to
  remove most of the 18 `"file" = line` entries in `.lintr`'s `exclusions: list()` by fixing the underlying lint,
  plus a strategy for the 152 residual lints. **No `R/`, `tests/`, or `.lintr` content changed** (plan only;
  implementation is the subsequent sessions, one phase at a time — FM #18/#25).
- **Evidence base:** firsthand `lint_package(parse_settings=FALSE)` (bypassing the exclusions so the suppressed
  lints are visible) = **41 lints suppressed by the 18 line-excludes + 152 residual = 193 total in `R/`**;
  cross-checked by an 18-file parallel examination workflow (`wf_c7863094-8f1`, one agent per file proposing the
  exact fix + risk rating) with adversarial verification of every behavior-affecting fix and commented-code
  deletion. **Three agent conclusions were corrected** by verification/reproduction (see plan §6).
- **Dispositions:** FIX 15 entries (~38 lints; 10 behavior-none, 5 low-risk verified-safe), KEEP-EXCLUDE 1
  (`makeGeneticDiversityDashboard.R` — author won't-delete, NEW-20), REMOVE-STALE + fix real lints 1
  (`getPyramidPlot.R = 25:27` suppressed 0 lints).
- **Config bugs found:** (1) `.lintr` lists `"R/CheckRequiredCols.R"` (wrong case) → the exclusion misses on
  case-sensitive CI; (2) the `getPyramidPlot.R = 25:27` exclusion is dead config; (3) the `source` "undesirable
  function" hits are a local variable named `source`, fixable by rename (zero behavior change); (4)
  `commented_code_linter` IS active via the tag set — the `#commented_code_linter = NULL` line is a dead no-op
  (resolves the issue #30 confusion).
- **Learning #53** (parse_settings=FALSE auditing trap; line-number drift both ways; verify-first over agent
  headlines). #30 stays OPEN (planning deliverable; implementation pending).

### 2026-06-11 — Fix issue #42: repoint pkgdown output off `docs/`; fix unmasked vignette bug; pkgdown GREEN on master (Session 52)
- **Deliverable (CI config + vignette fix / run-and-observe):** the `pkgdown` workflow failed its Build-site step on
  a fresh CI clone because `docs/methodology/` + `docs/planning/` are git-tracked inside pkgdown's default `docs/`
  output dir (no `pkgdown.yml` sentinel → `clean_site()` refuses to wipe a dir it didn't build → exit 1).
- **Fix = Option 2 (repoint pkgdown), not the issue's recommended Option 1 (relocate the doc trees).** Surfaced the
  choice via `AskUserQuestion`: Option 1 conflicts with the methodology framework's own `docs/methodology/`
  convention — the synced `methodology_dashboard.py` scores that path and the synced `SESSION_RUNNER.md`/
  `SAFEGUARDS.md` cross-link it (none durably editable in-repo). Verified from pkgdown 2.1.1 source + empirically
  that `build_site_github_pages()` overrides `_pkgdown.yml`'s `destination:` via `override = list(destination =
  dest_dir)`, so the yml alone is insufficient for CI. Commit `fcc154e8`: workflow `dest_dir = "pkgdown_site"` +
  deploy `folder: docs → pkgdown_site`; `_pkgdown.yml destination: pkgdown_site`; `.gitignore += pkgdown_site/`;
  `.Rbuildignore += ^pkgdown_site$`. No file moves; `docs/methodology`/`docs/planning`/dashboard/synced cross-refs
  untouched; gh-pages URL unchanged; no `R/` or `tests/` change.
- **Unmasked + fixed a separate latent bug** (commit `e89975c8`): with `clean_site` resolved, the build reached
  vignette rendering and failed on `ColonyManagerTutorial.Rmd` — its error table paired `names(getEmptyErrorLst())`
  (10 types) with 9 hardcoded descriptions ("arguments imply differing number of rows: 10, 9"). The NEW-45 "no
  period in IDs" feature added the `invalidIdChars` type without updating the vignette; added the missing
  description. This vignette is `.Rbuildignore`'d, so R CMD check never builds it — only pkgdown does (it ignores
  `.Rbuildignore`) — which is why it was green on all 5 R-CMD-check platforms yet fatal to pkgdown.
- **Validation (firsthand):** PR #43 pkgdown run `27361729368` (fresh-clone) SUCCESS → merged `--merge` to master
  `c6ad23dd` → master push run `27362288625` Build site **SUCCESS** + Deploy **SUCCESS**. **Closed issue #42.**
  Remaining CI red is lint (#30, known/accepted).

### 2026-06-11 — Promote `add-methodology` → master (PR #41) and live-validate `shinytest2`; close issue #40 (Session 51)
- **Deliverable (integration / run-and-observe):** promoted the long-lived `add-methodology` branch
  (105 commits / 356 files / +44,473−2,892; master a strict ancestor → 0 behind → clean conflict-free merge) to
  **master via PR #41** (merge commit `0363ffe3`, `--merge` to preserve the multi-session TDD history — never
  squashed). Pre-flight build-equivalent gate (non-e2e clean-regression read) = **2140 pass / 0 fail / 0 err /
  0 non-e2e offenders** (S49 baseline held); no branch protection on master.
- **Held the merge for the PR's first-ever remote CI**, triaging each red to root cause: **R-CMD-check passed on
  all 5 platforms** (macOS, Windows, ubuntu release/devel/oldrel-1) + test-coverage passed → package correctness
  intact; **pkgdown FAIL** = real but doc-site-deploy-only (`docs/methodology`+`docs/planning` tracked inside
  pkgdown's `docs/` output dir → `clean_site()` refuses to clean a non-pkgdown `docs/`) → logged as **issue #42**;
  **lint FAIL** = known style debt (#30); **codecov/patch+project FAIL** = external/advisory thresholds. Owner
  decision (`AskUserQuestion`): "merge now, fix pkgdown later".
- **Live validation (owner-designated gate):** `workflow_dispatch`-ed `shinytest2` on master → run `27356752221`
  **SUCCESS** (~19 min). All **13 per-module groups** (fresh `Rscript` each) reported `passed>0 failed=0 error=0`
  ("All 13 E2E module groups passed."). Both Session-34 live-runner watch items resolved on the first run:
  (1) renv lib-path resolution under `RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=false` (`R CMD INSTALL` + every AppDriver
  subprocess booted the app); (2) the 23-in-one-process Chrome flake — the 8e-7 per-module fresh-process grouping
  produced ZERO transient errors (first environmental confirmation; per-group isolation contains any future
  transient).
- **Closed issue #40** ("Strengthen shinytest2 E2E assertions") with a full validation comment — the §8e
  assertion-strengthening + CI-stability campaign is code-complete and live-validated on master.
- **Follow-ups logged (not done this session):** **#42** (relocate methodology docs out of pkgdown's `docs/`),
  **#30** (lintr cleanup) — both independent of package correctness.

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 8e-7 (CI per-module fresh-process grouping): run the 23-file shinytest2 E2E tier in 13 per-module groups, each in a fresh R process, to defang the 23-in-one-process Chrome flake (issue #40, Session 50)
- **Deliverable (CI config / run-and-observe):** plan slice **8e-7**
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md` §8/§8e-7 — the FINAL §8e slice) — replaced the
  single `test_dir(filter = "^(app|e2e)-", stop_on_failure = TRUE)` run step in
  `.github/workflows/shinytest2.yaml` with a **single job that loops over 13 per-module group regexes, each run
  in a fresh `Rscript` process**, so no one process accumulates 23 Chrome/AppDriver instances (the S34
  "process-count dragon": ~1 transient error / 5 full-tier single-process runs). Caps any process at ≤3 files.
- **Per group:** `test_dir(filter = rx, stop_on_failure = FALSE)` → a `passed/failed/skipped/error` report →
  fail/error > 0 ⇒ `quit(status = 1)` (checked FIRST, so a real failure is never mislabeled) → passed == 0 ⇒
  `stop()` **per-group silent-skip guard** (stronger than the old whole-run guard; a zero-match regex is caught
  separately by `test_dir`'s own "No test files found" abort). The bash loop runs ALL groups (full signal, one
  flake doesn't skip the rest) and reds the job if ANY group failed — preserving `stop_on_failure` semantics +
  the job env / Chrome provisioning / `R CMD INSTALL` / `timeout-minutes: 30` / removed `continue-on-error` (R6).
- **Owner-gated topology** (`AskUserQuestion`): single-job loop chosen over a 13-leg `strategy.matrix` (cheapest,
  plan-faithful, root-cause-sufficient — the matrix's 13× setup wasn't worth it for a nightly job). TDD =
  run-and-observe (CI config; no RED→GREEN, plan §6), gated `PRE-RED→run-and-observe`.
- **Verified locally:** the COMMITTED 13-regex partition selects EXACTLY the 23 `^(app|e2e)-` files — union ==
  tier, no overlap / gap / stray — against the full 182-file dir (replicating testthat's stripped-name match,
  Learning #33c); YAML parses (`yaml.safe_load`); run-step `bash -n` clean; the `Rscript -e '...'` block is
  single-quote-free; the run-step logic smoked on a throwaway dir (pass→exit 0, fail→exit 1, skip / nomatch →
  nonzero) — all four branches.
- **⚠ Live-runner-only (FM #24's cousin):** the flake mitigation is environmental — the partition / guard / exit
  logic is proven locally, but the 23-in-one-process flake can only be confirmed gone on the first live GitHub
  run (which requires the workflow on `master`). Ships UNVALIDATED locally; not claimed fixed until a live run
  shows it. Pushing `add-methodology` → master remains a SEPARATE deliverable.
- **Scope:** CI-config only (no `R/` / `tests/` change → the test suite is byte-identical). CHANGELOG-only (no
  package/source change).

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 8e-6c (real breeding-group flow): the 3 export-NULL'd Breeding-Groups E2E blocks become genuine data-bearing assertions → 8e-6 COMPLETE (issue #40, Session 49)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** plan slice **8e-6c**
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md` §5/§8e-6) — the **third and final vertical
  8e-6 flow**, completing the triad (pedigree ✓8e-6a, GVA ✓8e-6b, breeding ✓8e-6c). Drives the real
  breeding pipeline opt-in: `upload_and_wait(app, obfuscated_rhesus_mhc_ped.csv)` →
  `navigate_to_tab("Breeding Groups")` → `set_inputs(animalSource = "all", nIterations = 5)` →
  `click_element_safe("#breedingGroups-formGroups")` → `wait_for_module_ready("breedingGroups")` →
  `click_element_safe("a[data-value='Group Detail']")`, then asserts the rendered Group-Detail export
  buttons + DTs. Revives the 3 export-NULL'd Breeding-Groups blocks from Session 43 (D5
  `test-e2e-breeding-groups-detailed.R:89` export functionality, T7 `-tutorial.R:135` group export
  options, T9 `-tutorial.R:178` kinship-matrix export per group) from pane-active-only into data-bearing
  checks. Scope fixed by the owner's "8e-6c" instruction; full **RED→GREEN** (3 `AskUserQuestion` phase
  gates), REFACTOR declined (precedent + the GVA and breeding run-flows diverge on the nested-tab
  activation, so a "shared" run-flow helper is messier than a clean abstraction).
- **Hard gate first (the breeding spike):** a live-browser spike captured the recon's two open items
  firsthand before any RED. The Group-Detail nested `tabsetPanel` (`modBreedingGroups.R:72`) has **no
  `id`**, so it cannot be driven by `set_inputs` — it is activated via the unique DOM link
  `a[data-value='Group Detail']` (spike: `count == 1`). The spike proved both steps are required:
  post-formation but pre-activation, the export labels and rendered tables are still absent (the nested
  pane is `display:none`); only after the tab click do they enter the top-level active pane's innerText.
  `animalSource = "all"` uses `ped$id` directly, isolating breeding from the GVA dependency (the
  `topRanked` branch's `req(geneticValues())`, `appServer.R:272`).
- **Assertions (mutation-proven discriminating, RNG/seed-independent):** a static-UI download button is
  made data-bearing by PAIRING its visibility-gated label (matched via active-pane innerText, absent
  until the nested tab is activated) with a `suspendWhenHidden` rendered DT (which needs both group
  formation AND tab visibility). D5: `"Export Current Group"` + `grepl("Ego ID",` rendered
  `#breedingGroups-groupMemberTable)`. T7: `"Export Current Group"` + `"Age in Years"` member-table
  header. T9: `"Export Current Group Kinship Matrix"` + `grepl("<table",` rendered
  `#breedingGroups-groupKinTable)`. All tokens are static labels / rendered column-headers / table
  structure → verified GREEN with **no `NPRC_BG_SEED`** set. Group count and the within-group kinship
  invariant are deliberately NOT asserted (the algorithm formed one large MIS group from `numGp = 3`,
  and the strict kinship bound is unattainable because the module hardcodes `ignore = F–F`).
- **Verification:** D5/T7/T9 all GREEN live (`test-e2e-breeding-groups-detailed.R` 8/0/0,
  `test-e2e-breeding-groups-tutorial.R` 11/0/0); **[mutation-check] 13/13 all pass** (correct tokens →
  TRUE; wrong export label + imaginary column + right-token-wrong-table `"Ego ID"`-in-kin → FALSE;
  foreign pane (Pedigree Browser) → FALSE; pre-flow RED re-confirmed → FALSE). Non-e2e regression **2140
  `expectation_success` / 0 failed / 0 error / 159 skipped / 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings / 0
  non-e2e offenders**, proven byte-identical with and without the edit via a `git stash` diff (the edit
  touches only e2e blocks, which skip at `create_test_app()` before any assertion). The 2140-vs-Session-48's-2180
  figure is a measurement-method difference (`pkgload::load_all` under renv vs the bare system lib's
  missing Suggests deps), not a regression. Phase-3E = the live GREEN AppDriver runs (the real
  upload→QC→kinship→group-formation→Group-Detail render) + the mutation spike ARE the runtime check
  (#31). Test-tree-only → no `document()`/NEWS; `tests/` lint-exempt.

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 8e-6b (real GVA-run flow): the 2 NULL'd Genetic-Value E2E blocks become genuine data-bearing assertions (issue #40, Session 48)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** plan slice **8e-6b**
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md` §5/§8e-6) — the **second of three vertical
  8e-6 flows** (upload+QC ⊂ GVA ⊂ breeding). Drives the real Genetic Value Analysis pipeline opt-in:
  `upload_and_wait(app, obfuscated_rhesus_mhc_ped.csv)` → `navigate_to_tab("Genetic Value Analysis")` →
  set `nIterations = 100` (minimum allowed, for speed) → `click_element_safe("#geneticValue-runAnalysis")`
  → `wait_for_module_ready("geneticValue")`, then asserts the **rendered `#geneticValue-rankingsTable`**
  DOM. Revives the 2 NULL'd Genetic-Value blocks from Session 42 (B1
  `test-e2e-genetic-value-tutorial.R:99` Value Designation, B2 `:144` Z-score) from pane-active-only into
  data-bearing checks. Scope fixed by the owner's "8e-6b" instruction; full **RED→GREEN** (3
  `AskUserQuestion` phase gates), REFACTOR declined (a reusable GVA-run helper should co-design with
  8e-6c).
- **Hard gate first (the GVA spike):** a live-browser spike settled the rendered-table facts before any
  RED, correcting a static-read trap: `reportGV.R:144` `cbind(demographics, indivMeanKin, zScores, gu,
  offspring)` shows no `value` column, but `reportGV.R:146` wraps it as `orderReport(finalData, ped)`,
  which splits the frame → `rankSubjects()` adds the `value` ("High/Low/Undetermined") + `rank` columns →
  `rbind` re-flattens, so the rendered DT carries both `value` and `zScores`. The spike confirmed the
  default `topN = 20` view (`modGeneticValue.R:240`) truncates to the top-ranked (best) rows, which are
  **all "High Value"** — "Low Value"/"Undetermined" are truncated away, so the only faithful
  Value-designation token in the default render is `"High Value"`.
- **Assertions (mutation-proven discriminating, RNG/seed-independent):** B1 `"High Value"` (the Value
  designation rendered for the top-ranked rows); B2 `"zScores"` (the z-score DT column header). Both are
  structural invariants (a fixed column header; a designation guaranteed for the top rows) — verified by
  running GREEN with **no `NPRC_GVA_SEED`** set, so neither the 8e-5 seed hook nor value-stable RNG is
  required.
- **Verification:** 8/8 blocks GREEN in `test-e2e-genetic-value-tutorial.R` (the 6 static-UI blocks
  unaffected); **[mutation-check] all pass** (correct `"High Value"`/`"zScores"` → TRUE; wrong
  designation `"Low Value"`/`"Undetermined"` → FALSE; foreign-pane `"Form Groups"` (Breeding Groups) /
  `"Focal Animals"` (Pedigree) → FALSE; RED re-confirmed pre-run → both FALSE). Non-e2e regression
  **2180 `expectation_success` / 0 failed / 0 error / 156 skipped / 5 pre-existing `modPyramid`
  warnings / 0 non-e2e offenders** — Session 47 baseline held exactly (test-only change; the e2e file
  self-skips without `NPRC_RUN_E2E`). Phase-3E = the live GREEN AppDriver run (the real upload→QC→GVA
  pipeline) + the mutation spike ARE the runtime check (#31). Test-tree-only → no `document()`/NEWS;
  `tests/` lint-exempt.
- **Lib currency:** the AppDriver subprocess resolves the package from the SYSTEM lib
  (`/Library/Frameworks/.../R-4.5/...`) under `RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=false`; that install was
  already current (`gatedSeed` present, v1.1.0.9000) because `R/` was unchanged since Session 47's
  reinstall → no reinstall needed this session (verified currency firsthand; did not assume).

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 8e-6a (real upload+QC → pedigree-table flow): the 3 NULL'd pedigree E2E blocks become genuine data-bearing assertions (issue #40, Session 47)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** plan slice **8e-6a**
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md` §5/§8e-6) — the **first of three vertical
  8e-6 flows** (upload+QC ⊂ GVA ⊂ breeding). Drives the real pipeline opt-in for the first time in the
  E2E suite: `upload_and_wait(app, obfuscated_rhesus_mhc_ped.csv)` → `#dataInput-getData` →
  `navigate_to_tab("Pedigree Browser")`, then asserts the **rendered `#pedigree-pedigreeTable`** DOM.
  Revives the 3 NULL'd pedigree blocks from Session 40 (A1 `test-e2e-pedigree-module.R`, A2
  `-detailed.R`, A3 `-tutorial.R`) from pane-active-only into data-bearing checks. Owner-gated scope
  (8e-6a only); full **RED→GREEN** (4 `AskUserQuestion` gates), REFACTOR declined (idiomatic 3-line
  driver, no helper).
- **Hard gate first (the 8e-6 spike):** a live-browser spike settled the recon critic's blockers
  before any RED — (G4) the default `pedFile`/`pedigreeFileOne` upload flips `dataInput` ready and QC
  runs clean; (G5) the pedigree output is `suspendWhenHidden` (NULL until the Pedigree Browser tab is
  active, then renders all 375 rows — so the driver must `navigate` AFTER upload); (G2)
  `get_value(output="pedigree-pedigreeTable")` is a `json`-class string that **un-suspends to non-NULL
  even without data**, so the genuine data discriminator is the rendered-DOM content via
  `get_html_safe(app, "#pedigree-pedigreeTable")` — a refinement of the plan's §2.3 "output tier".
- **Assertions (all mutation-proven discriminating):** A1 `"of 375 entries"` (row count) + `"sire"`
  column; A2 + `"dam"` column; A3 `"dataTables_length"` (the "Show N entries" length menu) +
  `"of 375 entries"`. A4 ("status filter") left honest pane-active — no filter control exists (the
  table does render a `recordStatus` column, a future data-bearing option).
- **Fixture:** `inst/extdata/obfuscated_rhesus_mhc_ped.csv` (375 rows, canonical CSV; recon-verified to
  flow clean QC→GVA→breeding and already asserted error-free through the real `modInputServer`).
- **Verification:** 3/3 files GREEN (module 6/6, detailed 8/8, tutorial 9/9); **[mutation-check] all
  pass** (correct content TRUE; wrong row-counts 999/374, foreign column `genotype`, foreign-pane
  `Breeding Groups`, and the same pattern on a different element → all FALSE). Non-e2e regression
  **2180 `expectation_success` / 0 failed / 0 error / 156 skipped / 5 pre-existing `modPyramid`
  warnings / 0 non-e2e offenders** — Session 46 baseline held exactly (test-only change; the e2e files
  self-skip without `NPRC_RUN_E2E`). Phase-3E = the live GREEN AppDriver run (the real
  upload→QC→pedigree-render pipeline) + a mutation-check spike. Test-tree-only → no
  `document()`/NEWS; `tests/` is lint-exempt.
- **Environment note:** the AppDriver subprocess resolves `nprcgenekeepr` from the **system library**
  (`/Library/Frameworks/...`), not the renv cache, under `RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=false`;
  current source was reinstalled there first (the prior system-lib install was from Jul 2025).
- **Scope boundary:** GVA (8e-6b) and breeding-group (8e-6c) flows + their deferred blocks (2 GV from
  S42, 3 BG from S43) are deliberately deferred to their own sessions (FM #18/#25). `add-methodology`
  still not on remote.

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 8e-5 (Stochastic determinism hook): env/option-gated `set_seed()` in the GVA + breeding-group module servers — the FIRST 8e PRODUCTION `R/` change (issue #40, Session 46)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** plan slice **8e-5**
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md` §7) — the **only 8e slice that edits
  production `R/`** (`modGeneticValueServer` + `modBreedingGroupsServer`, both exported). Adds an
  **env/option-gated `set_seed()` hook** (Option A) so the stochastic GVA / breeding-group engines
  can be made reproducible on demand for E2E exact-value assertions, while the **default path is
  provably unchanged** (gate unset ⇒ no-op). Owner-gated (`AskUserQuestion` go/no-go chose Option A
  over Option B's user-facing UI seed input and Option C-only's no-production-change invariants),
  then full **RED→GREEN→REFACTOR**, every transition gated.
- **The gate (Option A):** at the top of each `eventReactive` body, immediately after `req()` and
  ahead of `withProgress` (so nothing between the seed and the engine consumes RNG):
  `seed <- getOption("nprcgenekeepr.gva_seed", as.integer(Sys.getenv("NPRC_GVA_SEED", NA)));
  if (!is.na(seed)) set_seed(seed)` — `modGeneticValue.R` ahead of `reportGV()` (gene-drop `sample`),
  `modBreedingGroups.R` ahead of `groupAddAssign()` (MIS `sample`), with
  `nprcgenekeepr.bg_seed` / `NPRC_BG_SEED`. Uses the existing **exported `set_seed()`** (pins
  `sample.kind="Rounding"`). Option precedence over the env-var fallback; both unset ⇒ `NA` ⇒ no seed.
- **REFACTOR:** the duplicated 3-line gate factored into one internal `@noRd` helper
  `gatedSeed(optionName, envName)` in `R/set_seed.R`; both module call sites now call it. Structure
  only — no behavior change, no new tests (the 8 tests validate the refactored helper via the
  `set_seed` mock + determinism). `gatedSeed` is `@noRd` ⇒ **no NAMESPACE / man delta**.
- **Tests (8 new, browser-free `testServer`; 3 RED + 1 guard per module):** determinism — with the
  option set, two `gvResults()` / `groups()` runs are `identical` (RED at HEAD: unseeded runs differ
  because RNG state carries across `testServer` invocations; a `length(.) > 0` assertion proves the
  capture is non-vacuous); `set_seed` mock — called once with the seed when the option is set (RED at
  HEAD: never called); env-var fallback — `NPRC_GVA_SEED` / `NPRC_BG_SEED` read when the option is
  absent (RED at HEAD); and the default-path **guard** — neither option nor env set ⇒ `set_seed` not
  called (green-on-arrival). RED confirmed firsthand (6 genuine failures + 2 guards passing) before
  GREEN; no synthetic RED.
- **Enabling baseline commit (separate, `d0989408`):** committed the owner's concurrent 14-file `R/`
  + `test_modPyramid.R` automated formatter pass (integer literals, quote style) on owner request, to
  give 8e-5 a clean baseline; re-verified behaviorally inert (regression held at 2166). A follow-on
  `docs:` commit regenerated 3 man pages (`appServer`, `modSummaryStatsServer`, `savePlotToFile`) the
  reformat desynced — the formatter had also rewrapped `#'` roxygen comments and changed
  `savePlotToFile`'s defaults to integer (`width=8L`), which would have tripped `R CMD check` codoc.
- **Verify:** non-e2e regression **2180 `expectation_success` / 0 failed / 0 error / 156 skip /
  5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings / 0 non-e2e offenders** (= the 2166 baseline + 14 new
  expectations; default analytical path unchanged — every existing test passes with the gate unset).
  **`devtools::check()` = 0 errors / 0 warnings / 3 NOTEs** (all pre-existing or environmental: the
  stale `spelling.Rout.save` baseline, "future file timestamps", non-standard top-level dev files —
  the S35 baseline; no new `gatedSeed` "no visible global" NOTE, confirming the lintr single-file
  flag is a stale-namespace artifact resolved by full-package analysis). Phase-3E runtime smoke:
  `runModularApp()` (working-tree source via `load_all`, so the hook is active) serves **HTTP 200** on
  the default gate-unset path. Lint net-zero on the changed `R/`.
- **Scope / docs:** the default analytical numerics are unchanged (gate is a no-op by default) →
  **CHANGELOG only, no `NEWS.md` bullet** (consistent with the modular-parity precedent). 8e-5
  enables the *optional exact-value* assertion tier in 8e-6 but does not block it (8e-6 can use
  Option-C structural invariants regardless).

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 8e-4 (Error-States + Boundary-Conditions): namespace fix + interaction revival; boot tautologies → behavioral active-pane assertions (issue #40, Session 45)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** plan slice **8e-4**
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md` §5) — the FIRST 8e slice that is
  **not pure run-and-observe**: a HYBRID of **RED→GREEN** (the `input-`→`dataInput-` namespace fix)
  and **run-and-observe** (the assertion conversions). Two files: `test-e2e-error-states.R` (13) +
  `test-e2e-boundary-conditions.R` (13) = **26** browser-booting `test_that` blocks, plus the
  `upload_and_wait` helper + its browser-free unit tests.
- **Namespace fix (§2.4, RED→GREEN, 5 sites):** the input module is mounted under the **`dataInput`**
  namespace (`appUI.R:123` `modInputUI("dataInput")`); `data-module="input"` (`modInput.R:31`) is a
  label, not the namespace. Fixed: `helper-shinytest2.R` `upload_and_wait` default `module_id`
  `"input"`→`"dataInput"` + the hardcoded `input-pedigreeFileOne` now DERIVED from
  `module_id`/`file_input_id` via `do.call`; `error-states` `#input-getData`→`#dataInput-getData`
  and `input-minParentAge`→`dataInput-minParentAge`; `boundary` `input-minParentAge`→
  `dataInput-minParentAge`. A new browser-free recording-stub unit test in
  `test_helper_shinytest2.R` anchors the helper fix in the always-run layer (+4 expectations).
- **Discriminators (firsthand-spiked):** for a namespaced **textInput** the wrong-id discriminator is
  the **value read-back** — shinytest2 `set_inputs` on an unbound id WARNS and never sets (it does
  NOT throw), so `get_value("dataInput-minParentAge")` stays at the default with the wrong id; for the
  **actionButton** it is the `app$click` **throw** (→ `click_element_safe`→FALSE). A no-file
  `getData` click surfaces the transient `showNotification("Please select a file first.")` warning,
  asserted via `#shiny-notification-panel`.
- **Conversions (23, run-and-observe):** the `nchar(html)>100` near-tautologies + dead-grepl +
  `interaction-noop-tryCatch` blocks now call `assert_active_pane(app, <pane>, <static-label>)` —
  Input/Pedigree/Pyramid/GV/BG control labels confirmed against the real active-pane innerText. The
  rapid-switch / repeat-click blocks assert the final pane (Home / Input); the narrow/short-window
  blocks assert Home active on boot. **Zero blocks deferred to 8e-6** (all static-pane assertions are
  available pre-data).
- **Verification:** helper unit tests **63/0/0** (the 2 new `upload_and_wait` tests green); e2e
  error+boundary browser run **26 blocks / 29 expectations GREEN, 0 failed / 0 error / 0 skip**
  (`filter="^e2e-(error|boundary)"`, `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true`). **[mutation-check] PASS**
  (correct GV pane→TRUE; wrong-pane / foreign-content "Number of groups"→FALSE; OLD whole-body
  grepl→TRUE content-blind contrast; namespace read-back + notification + wrong-selector→FALSE).
  Non-e2e regression **2166 `expectation_success` / 0 failed / 0 error / 156 skip / 5 pre-existing
  `modPyramid` warn / 0 non-e2e offenders** — S40–S44 baseline + exactly the +4 new helper
  expectations. Phase-3E satisfied (the live browser run + 2 spikes ARE the runtime, #31).
- **⚠ Concurrent formatter (not part of this deliverable):** at session start the tree was clean;
  mid-session an external automated style pass (`'…'`→`"…"`, `0`→`0L`) rewrote **14 `R/` production
  files** and briefly broke 2 (`makeFounderStatsTable.R:68`, `makeGeneticSummaryTable.R:58` — inner
  HTML quotes unescaped). Per SAFEGUARDS / FM #22 those unauthored uncommitted edits were NOT touched;
  the formatter self-healed both files and settled, and the regression confirmed the reformat is
  behaviorally inert. The 8e-4 commit stages ONLY the test-tree files + docs via explicit `git add`,
  leaving the owner's reformat as their in-progress work.
- **Scope:** test-tree-only (2 e2e files + helper + helper unit test) → no `document()`/NEWS;
  `tests/` is `.lintr`-excluded. Strict TDD, gated `PRE-RED→RED` then `RED→GREEN` via `AskUserQuestion`.

### 2026-06-09 — Phase 8e-3 FINAL (Settings-About + Workflow-Integration): boot-level tautologies → behavioral active-pane assertions; navbarMenu finalized (issue #40, Session 44)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the **LAST two 8e-3 files** of plan slice 8e-3
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md`) —
  `test-e2e-settings-about.R` (4) + `test-e2e-workflow-integration.R` (7) = **11 browser-booting
  `test_that` blocks**. Converts the content-blind `navigate_to_tab → grepl(get_html_safe(app,"body"))`
  idiom to behavioral `assert_active_pane(...)`. **8e-3 is now COMPLETE** (genetic-value S42 +
  breeding-groups S43 + settings-about/workflow S44).
- **Dragon resolved firsthand (R1 / §2.3 item 4, carried as a 🐉 by S42/S43):** a live-DOM spike
  (Rscript→AppDriver) confirmed a `navbarMenu("More")` child **becomes the lone active top-level
  `.tab-pane`** via `set_inputs(mainNavbar=child)` — top-level `.tab-content` count == 1,
  `get_active_pane_value`/innerText == the child (Settings/About/Help) content. So
  `navigate_to_menu_item`'s delegate body was already a genuine visible-pane switch; **only its
  docstring's shallow-coverage caveat needed retiring** (`helper-shinytest2.R:283-292`, body
  unchanged) → PURE run-and-observe, not a helper RED→GREEN.
- **Strict TDD — PURE run-and-observe** (no defect; all panes already render) → green-on-arrival
  `[refactor-only]` conversion, gated `PRE-RED→run-and-observe` via `AskUserQuestion`; rigor from a
  `[mutation-check]` (no synthetic RED).
- **Conversion map — 10 keep-regex-rescope · 1 navbar-chrome carve-out:**
  - **settings-about (4): all genuine grepl → keep verbatim, rescope to the navbarMenu child pane** —
    S1 `(Settings,"Settings|Configuration|options")`, S2 `(About,"About|Version|GeneKeepR|Oregon|Primate")`,
    S3 `(Help,"Help|Documentation|Online")`, S4 `(About,"NIH|funded|grant")`.
  - **workflow-integration (7):** W1 "visits N tabs" loop → 6 per-pane `assert_active_pane` checks with
    the threshold raised `>= 3` → `== 6L` (so a single failed nav reds the block); W2/W3 `is.list()`
    responsiveness tautologies → genuine pane-switch asserts (Input-then-Home; final-pane after a
    4-switch loop); W4 navbar brand → **CARVE-OUT** scoped to `.navbar-brand`
    (`grepl("GeneKeepR", get_html_safe(app, ".navbar-brand"))` — strictly stronger than the old
    whole-body grepl, since the brand lives outside any pane); W5 `(Input,"upload|file|browse")`,
    W6 `(Genetic Value Analysis,"Genetic|Value|Analysis|kinship|population")`,
    W7 `(Breeding Groups,"Breeding|Groups|formation|animals")`.
- **Helper:** `navigate_to_menu_item` docstring finalized (records the 8e-3 navbarMenu confirmation;
  no body change).
- **Verification:** browser run **11/11 GREEN / 12 expectations** (net-0 swap), 0 error / 0 skip
  (`filter="^e2e-(settings|workflow)"`). `[mutation-check]` PASS — settings-about arms via the spike
  (wrong-pane→FALSE, wrong-content→FALSE); workflow arms: W1 wrong-pane→FALSE (count would miss 6L),
  W4 scoped `grepl("Breeding", brand)`→FALSE while old whole-body `grepl("Breeding", body)`→TRUE
  (proves the old check was content-blind). Non-e2e regression **2162 `expectation_success` / 0 failed
  / 0 error / 156 skipped / 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings / 0 non-e2e offenders** — S40–S43
  baseline held EXACTLY (read via `expectation_success`, not `sum(nb)`, per Learning #43e). Phase-3E:
  the live browser run + two DOM spikes + the mutation-check spike ARE the runtime (#31 pattern).
- **Scope:** test-tree only (3 files: 2 test files + a test-helper docstring); `tests/` `.lintr`-excluded
  → lint-exempt; no `R/` change → no `document()`/NEWS (CHANGELOG only). Next: **8e-4** (namespace
  `input-`→`dataInput-` fix + error-states/boundary interaction revival), a separate session.
- See `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` Learning #44 for the full per-block detail and the navbarMenu/brand/threshold findings.

### 2026-06-09 — Phase 8e-3 part B-2 (Breeding-Groups family): boot-level tautologies → behavioral active-pane assertions (issue #40, Session 43)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the **Breeding-Groups family** of plan slice 8e-3
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md`) — `test-e2e-breeding-groups-module.R` (7),
  `test-e2e-breeding-groups-detailed.R` (7), `test-e2e-breeding-groups-tutorial.R` (9) = **23 browser-booting
  `test_that` blocks**. All converted from the content-blind `navigate_to_tab → grepl(get_html_safe(app,
  "body"))` idiom to `assert_active_pane(app, "Breeding Groups", <pattern>)`. The 2nd of three 8e-3 cuts
  (genetic-value done S42; settings-about + workflow-integration remain).
- **Strict TDD — PURE run-and-observe** (no defect; the Breeding Groups pane already renders and
  "Breeding Groups" IS the `tabPanel` title `appUI.R:166`) → green-on-arrival `[refactor-only]` conversion,
  gated `PRE-RED→run-and-observe` via `AskUserQuestion`; rigor from a `[mutation-check]` (no synthetic RED).
- **Conversion map by the Learning #40/#41/#42 split — 12 KEEP · 6 REVIVE · 1 ANCHOR · 4 NULL:**
  - **12 genuine `grepl` asserts → keep regex verbatim, rescope haystack to the active pane** (module
    M1–M7; detailed D1🐉/D3/D7; tutorial T2/T3).
  - **6 tautologies with a dead computed grepl → REVIVE that pattern, rescoped + pruned** (Learning #42a):
    D2 `harem` (✓"Harem (1M:NF)"), D4 `result|group|table|output|formed` (✓"group"; rest data-dependent →
    8e-6), T1 `group.*formation|source.*animal` (✓h3/guidance), T4 `Seed.*Group|seed.*animal|specific.*animal`
    (✓"Seed groups with specific animals"), T6 `Include.*kinship|kinship.*display` (✓"Include kinship in
    display of groups"), T8 `top.*ranked` (✓"Top ranked"). Pruned: inputId artifacts (`seedGroups`,
    `showKinship`), never-rendered framing words (`workflow`, `Choose.*group`, `pre.*seed`), and the
    foreign-module token `genetic.*analysis`.
  - **1 content-length tautology (`nchar(html) > 200`) → ANCHOR** to the always-visible guidance phrase
    "algorithm" (D6; `inst/extdata/ui_guidance/group_formation.html` "The algorithm ignores...").
  - **4 NULL-pattern (pane-active only):** D5/T7 (export) + T9 (export kinship matrix) — the
    `downloadButton`s live in the INACTIVE "Group Detail" nested tab (`display:none`, not in active-pane
    `innerText`; guidance has no export tokens) → defer to 8e-6 / nested-tab navigation; **T5** (infants-with-dam)
    — no such control exists in the modular UI (tutorial-only concept). Each NULL still upgrades the old
    `expect_true(TRUE)` by confirming the Breeding Groups pane is the active/visible one.
- **1 dragon kept verbatim, flagged in a comment, never renamed** (Learning #41a): D1 `size|number|count|
  animals` — no literal "size" control; matches via "number"/"animals" ("Number of groups:", "Number of top
  animals:", "Seed groups with specific animals").
- **Nested-tab visibility distinction (new this cut):** the nested tabsetPanel's NAV labels ("Groups",
  "Statistics", "Group Detail") ARE in the active-pane `innerText` (always visible), so M7 `statistic` anchors
  on the "Statistics" nav label and D4 "group" on the "Groups" nav label — but the inactive nested tabs'
  CONTENT (the export buttons) is hidden. The pre-gate critic settled this by RENDERING the actual Shiny
  `navbarPage`+`tabsetPanel` DOM; the browser run confirmed it firsthand (M7 GREEN).
- **Pre-gate adversarial verification (0 corrections, dispute resolved firsthand):** a 4-agent refutation
  workflow (3 source-grounded skeptics defaulting-to-refuted + a cross-checking critic) over the 23-block map
  BEFORE the TDD gate confirmed all 23 verdicts. It earned its keep by resolving the one genuine dispute (M7:
  is the nested nav label in `innerText`?) via a real Shiny DOM render and dismissing two skeptic refutations
  that rested on the opposite false premise — robust to 2/3 skeptics hitting stream-idle timeouts (1 full
  skeptic + 1 partial + the critic sufficed).
- **Verification:** browser run **23/23 blocks GREEN / 23 expectations** (1:1 swap, net 0), 0 error / 0 skip
  (`filter="^e2e-breeding-groups"`, env `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=false`).
  **[mutation-check] PASS** (inverted — Breeding Groups is the TARGET pane): correct `(Breeding Groups,"Form
  Groups")`→TRUE; wrong-pane `(Pedigree Browser,"Form Groups")`→FALSE; wrong-content `(Breeding Groups,"Focal
  Animals")`→FALSE ("Focal Animals" is Pedigree/Input-only `modPedigree.R:52`/`modInput.R:114`, grep-confirmed
  foreign to BG); old whole-body `grepl("Focal Animals",body)`→TRUE (content-blind contrast); active-pane
  innerText grepl→FALSE (sanity). Non-e2e regression (`NOT_CRAN=true`) — canonical testthat tally
  **2162 `expectation_success` / 0 failed / 0 error / 156 skipped / 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings /
  0 non-e2e offenders** — the S40–S42 baseline held EXACTLY (the 3 BG files self-skip at `create_test_app()`).
- **⚠ Measurement note (refines Learning #42d):** `sum(res$nb) - sum(res$failed)` is NOT the passed count —
  `nb` counts skip and warning rows too (2162 success + 156 skip + 5 warning = 2323). The canonical passed
  count is `expectation_success` (or the testthat reporter's `PASS` line). A "+161 pass" delta from a
  test-only e2e edit (provably impossible) was this formula artifact, diagnosed firsthand, not a regression.
- **Phase 3E:** test-tree-only deliverable — the live browser run (23 blocks via real AppDriver) + the live
  mutation-check spike ARE the runtime (#31 pattern); drove the real app, not just build-clean. No `R/` change
  → no `document()`/NEWS; `tests/` is `.lintr`-excluded.

### 2026-06-08 — Phase 8e-3 part B-1 (Genetic-Value family): boot-level tautologies → behavioral active-pane assertions (issue #40, Session 42)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the **Genetic-Value family** of plan slice 8e-3
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md`) — `test-e2e-genetic-value-module.R` (7),
  `test-e2e-genetic-value-detailed.R` (7), `test-e2e-genetic-value-tutorial.R` (8) = **22 browser-booting
  `test_that` blocks**. All converted from the content-blind `navigate_to_tab → grepl(get_html_safe(app,
  "body"))` idiom to `assert_active_pane(app, "Genetic Value Analysis", <pattern>)`.
- **Owner-scoped to ONE family** (`AskUserQuestion`): 8e-3 censused firsthand at **8 files / ~56 blocks**
  (~3× an 8e-2 session) — far past the family-per-session boundary the 8e-2 sessions (S38–S41) established —
  so it is split per the plan §5 "may split if oversized" + the don't-bundle dragon (FM #18/#25). This
  session did genetic-value only; **deferred to follow-on sessions:** breeding-groups family (3 files, ~23)
  and settings-about + workflow-integration (the navbarMenu finalization of `navigate_to_menu_item` +
  visit-N conversion, 2 files, ~11).
- **Strict TDD — PURE run-and-observe** (no defect; the GV pane already renders and
  `navigate_to_tab(app, "Genetic Value Analysis", "Genetic Value")` already targets the right tab —
  "Genetic Value Analysis" IS the `tabPanel` title `appUI.R:148` == the module h3 `modGeneticValue.R:32`)
  → green-on-arrival `[refactor-only]` conversion, gated `PRE-RED→run-and-observe` via `AskUserQuestion`;
  rigor from a `[mutation-check]` (no synthetic RED).
- **Conversion map by the Learning #40/#41 split** — 16 KEEP · 3 REVIVE · 1 ANCHOR · 2 NULL:
  - **16 genuine `expect_true(grepl(orig))` → keep regex verbatim, rescope haystack to the active pane**
    (module M1–M7; detailed D1/D2/D4/D5; tutorial T1–T4/T6).
  - **3 tautologies with a DEAD computed grepl pattern → REVIVE that exact pattern, rescoped** (new
    sub-case vs S41's "tautology → fresh anchor"): D3 `founder|equivalent|FE|genetic` (✓"founder" in the
    guidance "rare founder alleles" + "genetic" in the h3), D6 `report|export|download|summary`
    (✓"Export All/Subset" + "Summary" nested-tab label), T8 narrowed to `filter`
    (✓"Filter View"/"Filter by IDs").
  - **1 content-length tautology (`nchar(html) > 200`) → ANCHOR** to the distinctive always-rendered
    guidance phrase "ranks animals" (D7; `inst/extdata/ui_guidance/genetic_value.html`).
  - **2 NULL-pattern (pane-active only, data-bearing deferred to 8e-6):** T5 "Value Designation" and
    T7 "Z-score" are data-dependent results concepts absent from the static UI/guidance — no faithful
    default-visible pattern exists, so assert only that the GV pane is active (Learning #41a).
- **4 dragons keep their genuine regex verbatim** (Learning #41a — flag in a comment, never rename): M4
  `minimum|breeding|age` (no min-age control in GV; "breeding" matches guidance "breeding colony"); D1
  `population|select|animals|subset` (population is server-derived `modGeneticValue.R:148-162`; "animals"
  matches guidance "ranks animals" and "subset" matches "Export Subset"); T4 `dataTable|DTOutput|table|
  results|ranking` (the rendered table is `req(gvaView())`-gated → 8e-6; "ranking" matches the static
  "Rankings" nested-tab label).
- **Pre-gate adversarial verification narrowed the map** (Learning #40d/#41d): a 4-agent refutation
  workflow (3 source-grounded skeptics defaulting-to-refuted + a cross-checking critic) over the 22-block
  map BEFORE the TDD gate confirmed 21/22 and corrected **T8** — the revived dead pattern carried four
  alternatives (focal/display/Show.*entries/search) FOREIGN to the GV pane (copy-paste from another
  module); only "filter" matches default-visible innerText, so the revive was narrowed to `filter`. The
  critic also dismissed a skeptic's bogus newline-spanning false positive (R `grepl` `.` does not cross the
  newlines `innerText` inserts) and confirmed the two NULLs.
- **Verification:** browser run **22/22 blocks GREEN / 22 expectations** (1:1 swap, net 0), 0 error / 0 skip
  (`filter="^e2e-genetic-value"`, env `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=false`).
  **`[mutation-check]` PASS** (inverted — Genetic Value Analysis is the TARGET pane): correct
  `(Genetic Value Analysis,"Run Analysis")`→TRUE; wrong-pane `(Pedigree Browser,"Run Analysis")`→FALSE;
  wrong-content `(Genetic Value Analysis,"Focal Animals")`→FALSE (Pedigree-only label `modPedigree.R:52`,
  absent from the GV pane); old whole-body `grepl("Focal Animals")`→TRUE (content-blind contrast);
  active-pane innerText grepl→FALSE (sanity). Non-e2e regression **2162 passed / 0 failed / 0 error /
  0 non-e2e offenders** (156 skipped, 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings; the e2e-only change self-skips
  at `create_test_app()` `helper-shinytest2.R:196` — the 3 GV files showed 0/0/0/22-skip — so non-e2e counts
  are unaffected; S40/S41 baseline held EXACTLY).
- **Static UI only** (data-bearing GV outputs — rankings table, scatter plot, Summary table incl. Founder
  Equivalents/Value-Designation — are `req()`-gated and deferred to 8e-6). Test-tree-only → no
  `document()`/NEWS; `tests/` is lint-exempt (`.lintr:35`).

### 2026-06-08 — Phase 8e-2 (Pyramid family — the LAST 8e-2 cut → 8e-2 COMPLETE): boot-level tautologies → behavioral active-pane assertions (issue #40, Session 41)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the **Pyramid family** of plan slice 8e-2
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md`) — `test-e2e-pyramid-module.R` (6),
  `test-e2e-pyramid-detailed.R` (6) = **12 browser-booting `test_that` blocks**. Completes 8e-2
  (home-nav+app S38 + Input S39 + Pedigree S40 + Pyramid S41); the next slice is **8e-3**
  (genetic-value / breeding-groups / menu / workflow), a separate session.
- **Strict TDD — PURE run-and-observe** (no defect; the Pyramid pane already renders and
  `navigate_to_tab(app, "Age-Sex Pyramid", "Pyramid")` already targets the right tab — "Age-Sex Pyramid"
  IS the `tabPanel` title `appUI.R:139`, 3rd `fallback` arg a documented no-op `helper-shinytest2.R:250`)
  → green-on-arrival `[refactor-only]` conversion, gated `PRE-RED→run-and-observe` via `AskUserQuestion`;
  rigor from a `[mutation-check]` (no synthetic RED).
- All 12 blocks converted from the content-blind `navigate_to_tab → grepl(get_html_safe(app,"body"))`
  idiom to `assert_active_pane(app, "Age-Sex Pyramid", <pattern>)`, by the Learning #40 principled split:
  **(i) 10 genuine `expect_true(grepl(orig))` asserts** keep their original regex verbatim, only rescoping
  the haystack to the active pane (module L6/L25/L42/L59/L76/L93; detailed L6/L25[🐉]/L44[🐉]/L80);
  **(ii) 2 tautologies** upgrade to a precise default-visible anchor — detailed L63 `expect_true(TRUE)` →
  "Download Plot", detailed L99 `nchar(html) > 100` → "Age Plot".
- **0 NULL-pattern blocks** — unlike the Pedigree family (4 NULLs). The pyramid pane's static content is
  rich enough (sidebar controls + an UNCONDITIONAL guidance HTML panel) that every block has a
  default-visible anchor; none of the 12 blocks targets the data-dependent rendered plot / Statistics table
  (those `req(pedigreeData())`-gated outputs, `modPyramid.R:90-118`, are not what these tests assert), so
  nothing defers to 8e-6.
- **The two dragons** keep their keywords against always-rendered static text: detailed:25 `male|female|sex`
  is satisfied by the guidance HTML ("…males are plotted on the left and females on the right",
  `inst/extdata/ui_guidance/pyramidPlot.html` via `modPyramid.R:55-58`) + the h3 "Age-Sex Pyramid Analysis"
  — NOT the data-dependent plot axis labels; detailed:44 `max|maximum|age|limit` ("maximum age setting") is
  satisfied by the always-visible age labels ("Age Unit:", "Age Label Size:") — there is NO dedicated
  max-age control, so the genuine regex is kept verbatim and rescoped rather than renamed (out of scope for
  a haystack-rescope slice).
- **Pre-gate adversarial verification materially CORRECTED the map** (vs S40's 0/19-refuted confirmation):
  a 4-agent refutation workflow (3 source-grounded skeptics defaulting-to-refuted + a critic) over the
  12-block map BEFORE the TDD gate flagged **2/12** — both proposed NULLs (D3 "maximum age setting",
  D6 "data requirement message"). Correctly: D3's regex matches static "age" (→ KEEP, don't NULL) and D6's
  pane has always-rendered guidance (→ anchor "Age Plot", don't NULL+defer). Adopting both corrections
  yielded the 0-NULL outcome. The browser run remained the authoritative `[verify-first]`.
- **Static UI only** (data-bearing plot/table deferred to 8e-6 by virtue of not being targeted here).
- **Verification:** browser run **12/12 blocks GREEN / 12 expectations** (1:1 swap, net 0), 0 error / 0 skip
  (`filter="^e2e-pyramid"`, env `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=false`).
  **`[mutation-check]` PASS** (inverted vs the Pedigree slice — Pyramid is now the TARGET pane) —
  correct `(Age-Sex Pyramid,"Bin Size")`→TRUE; wrong-pane `(Pedigree Browser,"Bin Size")`→FALSE;
  wrong-content `(Age-Sex Pyramid,"Focal Animals")`→FALSE (Pedigree-only label `modPedigree.R:52`, absent
  from the Pyramid pane); old whole-body `grepl("Focal Animals")`→TRUE (content-blind contrast);
  active-pane innerText grepl→FALSE (sanity). Non-e2e regression **2162 passed / 0 failed / 0 error /
  0 non-e2e offenders** (156 skipped, 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings; the e2e-only change self-skips
  at `create_test_app()` so non-e2e counts are unaffected — S40 baseline held exactly).
- **Test-tree-only** → no `document()`/NEWS bullet, `tests/` lint-exempt. Phase-3E satisfied by the live
  browser run + mutation-check spike (the #31 pattern — drove the real app).

### 2026-06-08 — Phase 8e-2 (Pedigree family): boot-level tautologies → behavioral active-pane assertions (issue #40, Session 40)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the **Pedigree family** of plan slice 8e-2
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md`) — `test-e2e-pedigree-module.R` (5),
  `test-e2e-pedigree-detailed.R` (6), `test-e2e-pedigree-tutorial.R` (8) = **19 browser-booting `test_that`
  blocks**. Continues S38 (home-nav+app) and S39 (Input); 8e-2 now has only the **Pyramid family**
  (module/detailed = 12) left, as a separate session (plan R3 / FM #18/#25).
- **Strict TDD — PURE run-and-observe** (no defect; the Pedigree pane already renders and
  `navigate_to_tab(app, "Pedigree Browser", "Pedigree")` already targets the right tab — "Pedigree Browser"
  IS the `tabPanel` title `appUI.R:130`, and the 3rd `fallback` arg is an explicit no-op,
  `helper-shinytest2.R:250`) → green-on-arrival `[refactor-only]` conversion, gated `PRE-RED→run-and-observe`
  via `AskUserQuestion`; rigor from a `[mutation-check]` (no synthetic RED).
- All 19 blocks converted from the content-blind `navigate_to_tab → grepl(get_html_safe(app,"body"))` idiom
  to `assert_active_pane(app, "Pedigree Browser", <pattern>)`, by a principled split:
  **(i) genuine `expect_true(grepl(orig))` asserts** keep their original regex verbatim, only rescoping the
  haystack to the active pane (module L6/L25/L42/L76; detailed L6/L25/L44[🐉]/L82; tutorial L155[🐉]);
  **(ii) `expect_true(TRUE)` tautologies** upgrade to a precise default-visible anchor — "Display Unknown IDs",
  "Focal Animals", "Choose CSV file", "Trim pedigree", "Update Focal Animals", "Clear Focal Animals"
  (`modPedigree.R:52,72,79,86,105,118`); **(iii) honest NULL-pattern** `assert_active_pane(app, "Pedigree Browser")`
  for 4 blocks whose target is data-dependent or nonexistent — the DT table (module L59, detailed L63: renders
  only after `req(pedigreeData())` → deferred to 8e-6), DataTables "Show X entries" pagination (tutorial L28
  → 8e-6), and the "status filter" (detailed L101: no such static control exists).
- **The two dragons** (`pedigree-detailed:57` `sire|dam|parent|offspring|ancestor|descendant`,
  `pedigree-tutorial:174` `sire|dam|sex|birth|exit|age|gen|population`) keep their keywords — the column
  names are listed in the always-rendered `inst/extdata/ui_guidance/pedigree_browser.html` guidance panel
  ("Ego ID, Sire ID, Dam ID, Sex, Generation, and Population… Birth Date, Exit Date, Age").
- **Pre-gate adversarial verification:** ran a 4-agent refutation workflow (3 per-file skeptics + critic)
  over the 19-block map BEFORE posing the TDD gate — **0/19 refuted**, critic GO, all patterns confirmed
  default-visible, the 4 NULLs confirmed honest, and the mutation labels "Color Scheme"/"Bin Size" confirmed
  foreign (Pyramid-only). De-risks a slow browser cycle (`[right-sized-orchestration]` / `[completeness-workflow]`).
- **Static UI only** (data-bearing tables/plots deferred to 8e-6).
- **Verification:** baseline browser run 19/19 green → post-conversion **19/19 blocks GREEN / 19 expectations**
  (1:1 swap, net 0), 0 error / 0 skip (`filter="^e2e-pedigree"`, env
  `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=false`). **`[mutation-check]` PASS** —
  correct `(Pedigree Browser,"Focal Animals")`→TRUE; wrong-pane `(Age-Sex Pyramid,…)`→FALSE; wrong-content
  `(Pedigree Browser,"Color Scheme")`→FALSE (Pyramid-only label, absent from the Pedigree pane); old whole-body
  `grepl("Color Scheme")`→TRUE (content-blind contrast); active-pane innerText grepl→FALSE (sanity). Non-e2e
  regression **2162 passed / 0 failed / 0 error / 0 non-e2e offenders** (156 skipped, 5 pre-existing
  `modPyramid` warnings; the e2e-only change self-skips at `create_test_app()` so non-e2e counts are unaffected).
- **Test-tree-only** → no `document()`/NEWS bullet, `tests/` lint-exempt. Phase-3E satisfied by the live
  browser run + mutation-check spike (the #31 pattern — drove the real app).

### 2026-06-08 — Phase 8e-2 (Input family): boot-level tautologies → behavioral active-pane assertions (issue #40, Session 39)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the **Input family** of plan slice 8e-2
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md`) — `test-e2e-input-module.R` (5),
  `test-e2e-input-detailed.R` (6), `test-e2e-input-tutorial.R` (8) = **19 browser-booting `test_that`
  blocks**. Continues S38's home-nav+app sub-slice; 8e-2 is now ~half done. Pedigree and Pyramid families
  remain for later 8e-2 sessions (owner-directed scope: Input family only — plan R3 / FM #18/#25).
- **Strict TDD — PURE run-and-observe** (no defect; the Input pane already renders and
  `navigate_to_tab("Input")` already targets the right tab — "Input" IS the `tabPanel` title,
  `appUI.R:120-124`) → green-on-arrival `[refactor-only]` conversion, gated `PRE-RED→run-and-observe`
  via `AskUserQuestion`; rigor from a `[mutation-check]` (no synthetic RED).
- All 19 blocks converted from the content-blind `navigate_to_tab → grepl(get_html_safe(app,"body"))`
  idiom to `assert_active_pane(app, "Input", <static pattern>)`. Patterns sourced firsthand from the
  **`innerText` visibility-map** of the Input pane — default-visible sidebar controls (h3 "Data Input and
  Quality Control", "File Type", "Select Pedigree File", "Minimum Parent Age", "Read and Check Pedigree"),
  the nested-tab nav labels ("QC Summary", "Errors", "Cleaned Data", "Input Format"), and the active
  "Input Format" tab's `includeHTML(input_format.html)` guidance ("comma-delimited", "tab-delimited",
  "Excel", "genotype"). Conditionally-hidden controls (the Separator radio, non-default fileInputs) and
  non-active nested tabs are `display:none` → deliberately avoided.
- **Honest tautology conversion:** `input-detailed` "has example data option" (`expect_true(TRUE)`) names a
  feature the module does NOT have → converted to NULL-pattern `assert_active_pane(app, "Input")` (asserts
  navigation genuinely landed on the visible Input pane), not a forced match on incidental doc text.
  `input-tutorial` "genotype file support" (also a tautology) DOES have real backing → real `"genotype"`.
- **Static UI only** (data-bearing tables/plots deferred to 8e-6).
- **Verification:** baseline browser run 19/19 green → post-conversion **19/19 blocks GREEN / 19
  expectations**, 0 error / 0 skip (`filter="^e2e-input"`, env
  `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=false`). **`[mutation-check]` PASS** —
  correct→TRUE; wrong-pane `(Age-Sex Pyramid)`→FALSE; wrong-content `(Input,"Color Scheme")`→FALSE
  (Pyramid-only label, absent from the Input pane); old whole-body `grepl("Color Scheme")`→TRUE
  (content-blind contrast — exactly the defect the conversion closes). Non-e2e regression **2122 passed /
  0 failed / 0 error** (159 e2e-skipped, 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings — unchanged S38 baseline).
- **Test-tree-only** → no `document()`/NEWS bullet, `tests/` lint-exempt. Phase-3E satisfied by the live
  browser run + mutation-check spike (the #31 pattern — drove the real app).

### 2026-06-07 — Phase 8e-2 (home-nav + app-file sub-slice): boot-level tautologies → behavioral active-pane assertions (issue #40, Session 38)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the home-navigation + light-app-file sub-slice of plan slice 8e-2
  (`docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md`). 8e-2 spans 11 files / 64 browser-booting
  `test_that` blocks (plan risk R3 / §5 8e-2 dragon = oversized) → split by owner `AskUserQuestion`; this
  session did **home-navigation (10 blocks) + test-app-loading (2) + test-app-navigation (2)**. Input,
  pedigree, and pyramid families remain for later 8e-2 sessions.
- **Strict TDD — PURE run-and-observe** (no defect in scope; the app already behaves and every navigation
  targets the correct tab) → green-on-arrival `[refactor-only]` conversion, gated `PRE-RED→run-and-observe`
  via `AskUserQuestion`; rigor supplied by a `[mutation-check]` (no synthetic RED).
- **`test-e2e-home-navigation.R`** — 5 Home-pane content checks → `assert_active_pane(app, "Home", …)`;
  the 3 `#goto_*` clicks → `assert_active_pane(app, "Input" / "Pedigree Browser" / "Age-Sex Pyramid", …)`,
  turning a no-op-tolerant body-grepl into a real pane-switch assertion (the buttons are wired to
  `updateNavbarPage(...)`, `appServer.R:72-94`). The 2 navbar-label tests ("Navbar has all main tabs",
  "More menu exists") stay whole-DOM `grepl` **carve-outs** (navbar `<ul>`/dropdown labels live outside
  every `.tab-pane`; documented inline).
- **`test-app-loading.R`** — block 1 now also asserts the app boots to the **Home pane**
  (`assert_active_pane`); block 2's navbar body-grepl strengthened **structurally** to assert the real tab
  anchors exist (`wait_for_element(app, 'a[data-value="Input"]')` …), not a substring the Home pane's
  "Go to Input" button also satisfies. **`test-app-navigation.R`** — the two `nchar>0` tautologies become
  a real Input tab-anchor click → pane-switch assertion; the `is.list(values)` check gains
  `expect_identical(app$get_value(input="mainNavbar"), "Home")`.
- **Static UI only** (data-bearing tables/plots deferred to 8e-6); patterns sourced from each pane's module
  UI (`modInput.R:42`, `modPedigree.R:52,103`, `modPyramid.R:25-32`).
- **Verification:** opt-in browser run of the 3 files **14/14 blocks GREEN, 22 expectations** (net +2 vs the
  20-expectation baseline), 0 error / 0 skip. **Mutation check passed** — after `#goto_input`, asserting the
  wrong pane (`"Home"`/`"Age-Sex Pyramid"`) returns FALSE and a Pyramid-only pattern (`"Color Scheme"`)
  returns FALSE, while the old whole-body `grepl` for a Pyramid keyword passes on Input (content-blind).
  Non-e2e regression unchanged: **2122 passed / 0 failed / 0 error** (159 e2e-skipped, 5 pre-existing
  `modPyramid` warnings). Test-tree-only → no `document()`, no `NEWS.md` bullet, `tests/` is lint-exempt.

### 2026-06-07 — Phase 8e-1: active-pane assertion foundation + summary-statistics conversion (issue #40, Session 37)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** slice 8e-1 of `docs/planning/phase8e-assertion-strengthening-subplan.md`
  — the load-bearing foundation for converting the shinytest2 E2E suite from boot-level tautologies to
  behavioral active-pane assertions. Strict TDD (PRE-RED→RED, RED→GREEN gated) + a spike-failure scope-fork
  owner gate.
- **4 active-pane helpers** added to `tests/testthat/helper-shinytest2.R` — `get_active_pane_text`,
  `get_active_pane_value`, `wait_for_active_pane`, `assert_active_pane` (+ an internal `.active_pane_js()`
  builder), following the existing `*_safe` never-throw convention. `assert_active_pane()` is the drop-in
  replacement for the `get_html(app,"body")` + `grepl()` tautology: it asserts the NAMED top-level navbar
  pane is the single visible/active one (catching a wrong-tab or silent-no-op navigation) and optionally
  that its visible `innerText` matches a pattern. **11 browser-free unit tests / 59 expectations** in
  `test_helper_shinytest2.R` (fake-AppDriver stubs, the Phase-8a idiom).
- **Spike-corrected mechanism (HARD GATE).** The live-Chrome spike FALSIFIED the plan's §2.3/§4 selector
  (`.tab-content > .tab-pane.active`): the modules nest their own `tabsetPanel`s, so `.tab-content` is
  non-unique (5 containers; first-match `querySelector` latches onto a nested pane). Corrected to the only
  `.tab-content` not inside a `.tab-pane` → its direct-child `.tab-pane.active` (structural; no dependence
  on the dynamic `data-tabsetid`). Owner-approved deviation; re-confirmed 17/17 through the real helpers
  (all navs incl. the navbarMenu "More" children; innerText honors visibility when correctly scoped).
- **`test-e2e-summary-statistics-module.R` converted** — fixed the 7 wrong-tab navigations (tests 2–8 went
  to "Genetic Value Analysis"; "Summary Statistics" is its own `tabPanel`, appUI.R:156-159) + dropped the
  false "embedded in another tab" fallback, and replaced all 8 tautologies/hidden-DOM asserts with
  `assert_active_pane()` on STATIC UI (export-button labels, the heading, the population-genetics guidance).
  Data-bearing content (summary/founder tables, rendered plots) deferred to slice 8e-6.
- **Verification:** helper unit tests 59/0/0; live spike 17/17; converted e2e file 8/8/0 (opt-in); mutation
  check PASS (wrong-tab→FALSE, correct-tab→TRUE — the old `expect_true(TRUE)` passed both); non-e2e
  regression 2122 passed / 0 failed / 0 error (159 e2e-skipped, 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings).
- **Scope:** test-infra only (no `R/` change) → `document()` N/A, `tests/` lint-exempt, CHANGELOG only (no
  NEWS). See `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md` Learning #37 + glossary `[hard-gate-spike]`.

### 2026-06-06 — Phase 9: retire the legacy monolithic Shiny app (declare modular canonical) + #27 CLOSED (Session 35)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the FINAL phase of the shiny-module conversion
  (`docs/planning/shiny-module-conversion-plan.md` §9 Phase 9) — retire the monolith now that the
  modular app is canonical and at parity (Phases 1–8). Strict TDD (RED→GREEN gated) + 4 owner
  `AskUserQuestion` gates + the pre-RED→RED / RED→GREEN TDD gates. **This completes the entire
  XARCH-1 / issue-#27 modularization campaign (Phases 1–9).**
- **`runGeneKeepR()` → deprecated alias.** Rewrote it as a `lifecycle::deprecate_soft()` alias
  launching `runModularApp(port=6013L, launch.browser=TRUE)`; zero-arg callers keep working. New
  `tests/testthat/test_runGeneKeepR_alias.R` (deprecation + delegation + port/launch.browser
  forwarding) and `test_monolith_removed.R` (`system.file("application")==""`).
- **Deleted `inst/application/`** (server.r, ui.r, global.R, 8 uitp*.R, example_1.R, the dead
  modPyramid.R stub, www/ — 17 tracked files) as its own revertible commit (§15). `inst/www/`
  (the modular app's `data-ready.js`) preserved.
- **Removed confirmed orphans (owner-approved):** `getMinParentAge` (unexported, 0 callers),
  `getLogo` (exported, monolith-only — a public-API removal), `shouldShowErrorTab` (exported but
  bypassed by `checkErrorLst`; also dropped the dead `qcResults` build in appServer.R + the
  `@seealso` refs), `modMinimalTest` (unmounted scaffold) + their tests. `document()` dropped 4
  exports + 4 man pages.
- **NAMESPACE fallout fixed:** `getMinParentAge.R` was the SOLE carrier of `@import shiny`, so its
  deletion dropped `import(shiny)` and the modular UI failed (`h5` not found); relocated
  `@import shiny` to `R/nprcgenekeepr-package.R`. Caught by the regression run, not the inventory
  (Learning #35).
- **Pre-flight (irreversible delete):** re-ran the §10 grep-inventory as a read-only multi-modal
  sweep + completeness critic (`wf_48a6f152-f0f`); firsthand-verified the sole `system.file`
  reference, `inst/www` ≠ `inst/application/www`, the lifecycle dep, and that all 17 files are
  tracked/revertible.
- **Docs:** `_pkgdown.yml` (drop getLogo/getMinParentAge), `inst/WORDLIST`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `ROADMAP.md` (milestone marked complete), `NEWS.Rmd`/`NEWS.md` (monolith-retirement bullet),
  vignette `_running_shiny_application.Rmd` → `runModularApp()`; `README.md` re-knit.
  (`a3manual`/`a2interactive` `.md/.html/.R` are stale-by-design release artifacts — rebuilt from
  source at release; `check()` builds vignettes from source regardless.)
- **Verification:** non-e2e regression **2135 passed / 0 failed / 0 error** (5 pre-existing
  modPyramid warnings); runtime smoke `runGeneKeepR()` → modular app **HTTP 200**;
  **`devtools::check()` = 0 errors / 0 warnings**, `creating vignettes ... OK` (pre-existing NOTEs
  only: non-standard top-level dev files; a stale `spelling.Rout.save` baseline); grep confirms no
  `system.file("application")`.
- **Pre-existing fix (separate `fix:` commit, owner-approved):** `a2interactive.Rmd` error-list
  table was missing the `invalidIdChars` description (NEW-45 drift: `getEmptyErrorLst()` has 10
  fields vs 9 hardcoded) — failed the vignette build; surfaced by the full `check()`.
- **Issue #27 (Modularize code using shiny modules) CLOSED.**
- Commits: `3db018d1` (refactor!: alias + orphans), `24992e0b` (feat!: delete monolith),
  `53a9e5e0` (docs), `a1618c48` (fix: a2interactive vignette), + this `docs:` close-out.

### 2026-06-06 — Implement Phase 8d of the conversion E2E harness: interaction/menu tier green + CI filter broadened to the full tier + #39 CLOSED (Session 34)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the FINAL sub-phase of the Phase 8 E2E mini-campaign
  (`docs/planning/phase8-e2e-harness-subplan.md` §5(8d)) — the **5 interaction/menu E2E files**
  (home-navigation, settings-about, workflow-integration, error-states, boundary-conditions; 47 blocks /
  53 expectations) green-or-clean-skip opt-in, **broaden the CI run-step filter** to the full
  `^(app|e2e)-` tier (all 23 files), **close issue #39**, and file the 8e follow-on (#40).
  **Config / run-and-observe** (TDD code-phases INAPPLICABLE — owner-approved gate, like 8b/8c): the
  §8.2 navbarMenu spike + the 53/53 green run proved the provisional `navigate_to_menu_item` is already
  correct, so the only code touch is a comment-only docstring + the CI YAML filter — no R unit to write
  test-first.
- **§8.2 navbarMenu spike — RESOLVED (verify-first, before classifying).**
  `set_inputs(mainNavbar="Settings"/"About"/"Help")` → `get_value(input="mainNavbar")` reads back the
  child label TRUE for all 3 → `navigate_to_menu_item`'s delegate-to-`navigate_to_tab` body is final
  (no DOM dropdown-open+click). `click("#goto_input")` navigates for real. **Honesty nuance (→ 8e/#40):**
  the input value reaches the navbarMenu child but the VISIBLE pane does not truly switch — `grepl(body)`
  passes only via the §2.3 hidden-DOM (§8.3 navigation-false-positive).
- **The 5 8d files — green opt-in.** `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true` → 47 test_that blocks /
  53 expectations, 0 fail / 0 error / 0 skip. All four S33 Watch items confirmed benign firsthand
  (E2E_TIMEOUT defined + only used inside test blocks; the 6 `#goto_*` observers wired `appServer.R:73-95`;
  boundary's named `height/width` handled by `create_app_driver`; the `input-` selectors stay
  tryCatch-swallowed no-ops — 8e).
- **CI filter broadened** to `^(app|e2e)-` (verified firsthand it selects EXACTLY the 23 test-{app,e2e}-*
  files — replicating testthat's stripped-name match in R — and excludes the `appServer` near-miss via
  the trailing `-`); job env + `stop_on_failure=TRUE` + the `sum(passed)==0` silent-skip guard unchanged.
  Full tier re-validated in ONE process: **193 passed / 0 fail / 0 error / 0 skip**, 23 files.
- **⚠ Low-rate Chrome process-count FLAKE found + handled.** An ultracode 4-lens adversarial review
  (`wf_ef031b1d-edc`) caught that the 23-in-one-process run is intermittently flaky — ~1 transient Chrome
  error in 5 local full-tier runs (`workflow-integration.R` "App maintains state when switching tabs";
  isolated 8/8/8) — the §5(8c)/R2 dragon; under `stop_on_failure=TRUE` it can red the scheduled job.
  Reproduced firsthand (2 fresh dedicated runs clean → low-rate + contention-sensitive). **Owner decision
  (`AskUserQuestion`): close #39 now + document the flake**; CI-stability hardening (per-group fresh
  processes) routed to #40.
- **Issue tracker:** **#39 CLOSED** (`--reason completed`, with a validation/watch-item comment).
  **8e filed as #40** ("Strengthen shinytest2 E2E assertions…", label `enhancement`) capturing the
  §2.4/§2.5/§6 deferred items + today's navbarMenu false-positive, plus a CI-stability comment for the flake.
- **Validation:** §8.2 read-backs TRUE; 53/53 8d green; 193/0/0/0 full-tier single-process; non-e2e
  regression (`NOT_CRAN=true`, NPRC_RUN_E2E unset → e2e clean-skip) = **0 failed / 0 error**, 0 non-e2e
  offenders, 2159 passed, 156 e2e-skipped, 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings (unchanged
  S31/S32/S33 baseline). Diff is comment-only (helper docstring) + the CI filter → `document()` N/A,
  `tests/`+`.github` lint-exempt, no `* 2.*` source dupes; committed `d254a91c` with **explicit
  `git add`** of only the 2 files (the review's `.DS_Store` BLOCKER). **Live GitHub run DEFERRED**
  (branch not on remote) — TWO watch items now (renv lib-path + the flake).
- **Next:** parent **Phase 9** (declare the modular app canonical + DELETE the monolith — IRREVERSIBLE,
  its own session, do NOT bundle; confirm with the owner + grep-inventory first). The #39 E2E
  mini-campaign (8a–8d) is COMPLETE.

### 2026-06-05 — Implement Phase 8c of the conversion E2E harness: per-module shallow tier green + CI filter broadened (issue #39) (Session 33)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the third sub-phase of the Phase 8 E2E mini-campaign
  (`docs/planning/phase8-e2e-harness-subplan.md` §5(8c)) — run-and-observe the **15 shallow per-module
  E2E files** (103 tests) green opt-in, and **broaden the CI run-step filter** in
  `.github/workflows/shinytest2.yaml` from the 3 boot-smoke files to the **18 verified 8b+8c files**.
  **Config / run-and-observe** (TDD code-phases INAPPLICABLE — approved gate, like 8b): the 15 files +
  the 8a helpers already exist and pass trivially via the §2.3 navbarPage hidden-DOM, so there is **no new
  R unit to write test-first**; the browser spike is the verification and the only artifact change is the
  CI YAML filter.
- **8c browser spike — green opt-in.** With `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true`, run per module-group:
  `e2e-input` (19), `e2e-pedigree` (19), `e2e-pyramid` (12), `e2e-genetic-value` (22),
  `e2e-summary-statistics` (8), `e2e-breeding-groups` (23) = **103 tests across 15 files,
  0 fail / 0 error / 0 skip.** Chrome launches and the modular app boots for every test.
- **Helper corner-cases verified firsthand (§5(8c) DONE):** (a) `navigate_to_tab`'s 3rd arg is the
  ignored `fallback` — the pyramid files navigate to the top-level "Age-Sex Pyramid" tab and pass
  (modPyramid's "Plot"/"Statistics" sub-tabs are never targeted); (b) the only content-coupled assertions
  (`pedigree-detailed.R:57`, `pedigree-tutorial.R:169`) pass on the always-rendered `pedigree_browser.html`
  guidance — noted, not changed; (c) `summary-statistics-module`'s wrong-tab navigation (7/8 tests go to
  "Genetic Value Analysis", §2.4) still passes via the hidden-DOM — a known 8e item, not an 8c blocker.
- **CI filter broadened** (owner-approved): the run-step `filter` goes from
  `^(app-loading|app-navigation|e2e-data-ready)$` to
  `^(app-loading|app-navigation|e2e-data-ready|e2e-input|e2e-pedigree|e2e-pyramid|e2e-genetic-value|e2e-summary-statistics|e2e-breeding-groups)`.
  Verified firsthand the regex selects **exactly the 18 files** (3 8b + 15 8c) and **excludes exactly the
  5 Phase-8d files** (home-navigation, settings-about, workflow-integration, error-states,
  boundary-conditions) — those enter CI only once 8d verifies them. The `stop_on_failure=TRUE` +
  `sum(passed)==0` silent-skip guard and the job env block are unchanged.
- **Validation:** the **exact broadened run-step re-run locally in a single process** (the §5(8c)
  AppDriver-process-count dragon — 18 files × drivers in one `test_dir`) → **18 files, passed=140 /
  failed=0 / skipped=0 / error=0** (37 8b + 103 8c), exit 0. Full non-e2e suite under
  `pkgload::load_all`+`NOT_CRAN=true` = **0 failed / 0 error**, 0 non-e2e offenders, 156 e2e-skipped,
  2154 passed, 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings (unchanged S31/S32 baseline). YAML parses; no R/test
  code changed → `document()` N/A, `tests/`+`.github` lint-exempt, no `* 2.*` source dupes. **Live GitHub
  run deferred** (branch not on remote; same posture as S32) — the run-step is validated locally
  end-to-end. **No adversarial workflow** (no ultracode opt-in; a one-line filter broadening validated
  end-to-end is "already verified" — a multi-agent review would be ceremony for this change surface).
- **Next:** Phase 8d (5 interaction/menu files, 47 tests — needs the secondary helpers + the navbarMenu
  spike → **close #39** + file the 8e assertion-strengthening issue). Then parent Phase 9 (monolith
  deletion, irreversible).

### 2026-06-05 — Implement Phase 8b of the conversion E2E harness: first browser run + CI rewire (issue #39) (Session 32)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the second sub-phase of the Phase 8 E2E mini-campaign
  (`docs/planning/phase8-e2e-harness-subplan.md` §5(8b)) — the **first-ever real browser run** of the
  modular GeneKeepR app under `shinytest2`/`chromote`, plus the **CI rewire** of
  `.github/workflows/shinytest2.yaml`. **Config-only** (TDD code-phases INAPPLICABLE — approved gate):
  the 3 boot-smoke files use `create_test_app()` + `AppDriver$new` directly / `testServer` (no new
  helpers), so the deliverable is the empirical spike + the CI YAML, not RED→GREEN code.
- **🐉 First browser run — green opt-in.** With `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true NOT_CRAN=true`, all 3 boot-smoke
  files run green: `test-app-loading.R` (2), `test-app-navigation.R` (3), `test-e2e-data-ready.R` (32)
  = **37 tests, 0 fail / 0 error / 0 skip.** Chrome launches and the modular app boots. The
  **navigation spike (§8.1) resolved positively** — `a[data-value="Input"]` clicks against the live
  bslib navbar (no self-skip).
- **CI `shinytest2.yaml` rewired** (owner decision: scheduled + manual): triggers → `schedule`
  (`0 7 * * *`) + `workflow_dispatch` (dropped per-PR push/pull_request); `NPRC_RUN_E2E:'true'` at
  **job-level `env:`**; `continue-on-error` **removed**; Chrome via **`browser-actions/setup-chrome@v2`**
  (`install-dependencies:true`) + `CHROMOTE_CHROME` via `$GITHUB_ENV` + a `find_chrome()` resolve-assert;
  runs only the 3 smoke files with `stop_on_failure=TRUE`; `_snaps/`+`*.png` artifact upload kept.
- **Adversarial review caught a HIGH blocker I missed** (4-lens + completeness-critic workflow,
  re-verified firsthand): the rewrite added `NPRC_RUN_E2E` but **not `NOT_CRAN`** → on the non-interactive
  `Rscript` runner `skip_on_cran()` fires → all 3 files **silently skip** → `stop_on_failure` doesn't
  catch skips → the job goes green having run nothing. Reproduced firsthand (NOT_CRAN unset → 4 skipped,
  0 run). Fixed: `NOT_CRAN:'true'` at job env. Also hardened: (a) `RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED:'false'`
  so the package installs to the **site** lib (the renv autoloader otherwise targets renv's private lib,
  which the AppDriver subprocess can't see); (b) an **executed-count guard** (`stop()` if
  `sum(res$passed)==0`) to make the silent-skip class fail loud; (c) a stronger `find_chrome()` assert
  (single existing path, not bare `nzchar` which passes vacuously on `NULL`).
- **Package-install step added** (was missing): `R CMD INSTALL .` after `setup-r-dependencies`, since the
  app subprocess does `library(nprcgenekeepr)` and `create_test_app()` uses `system.file(package=)`.
- **No R/test code changed** (sub-plan §11 — the E2E files are run/triaged, not rewritten). Full non-e2e
  suite under `pkgload::load_all`+`NOT_CRAN=true` = **0 failed / 0 error**, 0 non-e2e offenders, e2e
  skipped (156), only the 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings — unchanged from the S31 baseline.
- **Verification limit (stated, not skipped — not FM #24):** the CI YAML is verified **statically** (YAML
  parse + 4-lens adversarial review + the exact run-step R validated locally) but **not by a live GitHub
  run** — branch `add-methodology` isn't on the remote and a live run would create a remote feature branch
  (owner chose static + adversarial only). The renv lib-path / AppDriver-subprocess interaction is the #1
  item to confirm on the first live run. `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` activate once merged to master.
- **Files:** `.github/workflows/shinytest2.yaml` (rewritten); `docs/planning/phase8-e2e-harness-subplan.md`
  §7 (synced — the spec had omitted `NOT_CRAN`). Next: **Phase 8c** (15 shallow per-module files).

### 2026-06-05 — Implement Phase 8a of the conversion E2E harness: define the 6 driver helpers + E2E_TIMEOUT (issue #39) (Session 31)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** the first sub-phase of the Phase 8 E2E mini-campaign
  (`docs/planning/phase8-e2e-harness-subplan.md` §5(8a)) — defined the 6 shinytest2 driver helpers
  + the `E2E_TIMEOUT` constant in `tests/testthat/helper-shinytest2.R`, **browser-free RED→GREEN**
  under strict TDD (resumed after the two planning sessions #21/#30).
- **Helpers added:** `create_app_driver(app_dir, name, height=800, width=1200, ...)`,
  `navigate_to_tab(app, tab_label, fallback=NULL)` (sets `mainNavbar`, returns TRUE only if the tab
  reads back — catches a silent no-op nav), `get_html_safe`/`get_values_safe`/`click_element_safe`
  (`tryCatch`-guarded → `""`/`list()`/`FALSE`), `navigate_to_menu_item` (provisional delegate to
  `navigate_to_tab`; finalized in 8d), and `E2E_TIMEOUT <- 30000L`.
- **Caught a latent bug in the plan's §4 pseudo-code** ([verify-first] on the approved plan): the
  literal `create_app_driver(app_dir, name, ...)` hardcodes `height`/`width` then splices `...`, so the
  2 `test-e2e-boundary-conditions.R` calls passing `height=`/`width=` would duplicate-crash
  `AppDriver$new` (*"formal argument 'height' matched by multiple actual arguments"* — verified that
  `AppDriver$new` has explicit `height`/`width` formals). Fixed by exposing them as named formals; the
  deviation was approved in the PRE-RED→RED phase gate.
- **Tests (browser-free, new file `tests/testthat/test_helper_shinytest2.R`):** 14 `test_that` /
  32 assertions using fake-AppDriver `list()` stubs (throwing / recording-ok / silent-no-op) to
  discriminate the existence, signature, `*_safe` error, success, and read-back contracts — no Chrome
  needed (mirrors `test_create_test_app.R`). All RED at HEAD, GREEN after.
- **Verification:** full non-e2e suite `0 failed / 0 error`, **2154 passed** (+32), e2e skipped (156),
  only the 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings; `document()` zero `man/`/`NAMESPACE` delta; `tests/`
  is `.lintr`-excluded → lint-exempt. Phase 3E N/A (helpers live only in the test tree — the suite is
  the runtime). Learning #31. **Next: Phase 8b** (boot-smoke tier + CI rewire — first browser run).

### 2026-06-05 — PLAN: Phase 8 sub-plan — enable the shinytest2 E2E harness (XARCH-1 / issue #39) (Session 30)
- **Deliverable (planning, not implementation):** `docs/planning/phase8-e2e-harness-subplan.md` —
  a sub-plan for the conversion campaign's Phase 8 (make the dormant shinytest2 browser E2E tier
  executable). The campaign's second planning/architecture deliverable. No code written (FM #18/#19).
- **Corrected the parent plan §9 Phase 8** via firsthand discovery (greps + R one-liners + a read-only
  workflow: 5-agent census of all 23 E2E files + adversarial completeness-critic, 16 findings
  re-verified firsthand): the gap is **6 undefined helpers + 1 undefined constant** (`create_app_driver`
  with `...`→height/width, `navigate_to_tab(app, label, fallback=NULL)` [109/137 calls 3-arg],
  `get_html_safe`, `click_element_safe`, `navigate_to_menu_item`, `get_values_safe`, `E2E_TIMEOUT`),
  **not the "3 helpers"** the parent plan claimed — and Phase 8 is a **4-session mini-campaign (8a–8d)**,
  not one session.
- **Key findings:** the `navbarPage` renders ALL tabs' static UI into the DOM at boot
  (`appUI()` = 85 KB), so the suite's dominant `grepl(keyword, "body")` checks **pass trivially once the
  app boots** → "harness runs green" ≠ "validates behavior" (41 `expect_true(TRUE)` tautologies;
  `summary-statistics-module` navigates to the wrong tab in 7/8 tests yet passes). The `input` vs
  `dataInput` namespace mismatch is real but **inert** (polling helpers never called).
- **Owner decisions (`AskUserQuestion`):** (1) scope = **harness-enable (8a–8d)** → assertion-strengthening
  filed as a separate follow-on issue ("8e"); (2) CI gating = **scheduled + manual dispatch** (not per-PR),
  drop `continue-on-error`, keep fast unit CI as the per-PR gate.
- **Plan structure:** 8a helpers/constant (browser-free RED→GREEN) · 8b boot-smoke + CI rewire (first
  browser run) · 8c 15 shallow per-module files · 8d 5 interaction/menu files → close #39. Each sub-phase
  has DONE + verify-command + session boundary; 23 files / 159 tests fully assigned. Updated parent plan
  §9 + `BACKLOG.md` to point at the sub-plan. Learning #30.

### 2026-06-05 — Implement Phase 7 of the Shiny-module conversion: Input parity, focal-animal / LabKey pedigree build (Session 29)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** wired the modular **Data Input** module's "Focal animals only;
  pedigree built from database" path so an uploaded focal-animal ID list builds a pedigree from the
  ONPRC LabKey EHR — bringing modular `modInput` to monolith parity (plan §9 Phase 7; monolith
  server.r:86-113). All in `R/modInput.R`, inside `observeEvent(input$getData)`:
  1. **Server-side gap fixed.** The UI option already existed (`modInput.R:70` radio /
     `:111-116` `breederFile` / `:244` `activeFile`) but was **broken**: the focal-ID file was read
     *as a pedigree* by `readDataFile()` → a spurious "missing columns" QC error. Now, when
     `input$fileContent == "focalAnimals"`, the module calls `getFocalAnimalPed(file$datapath, sep)`
     to build the pedigree from the EHR, then feeds it into the existing `qcStudbook`/`runQcStudbook`
     machinery unchanged.
  2. **DB-failure routing.** A `getLkDirectRelatives` connection failure makes `getFocalAnimalPed`
     return an `nprcgenekeeprErr` errorLst; the module routes it to `storedErrorLst()` (cleaned =
     NULL, early return) so the already-wired appServer dynamic **Error List** tab surfaces
     `failedDatabaseConnection` ("Database connection failed…"). No new renderer/appServer code.
- **Built more correctly than the monolith.** The monolith detects the error shape with
  `is.element("nprckeepErr", class(...))` — a **typo** (the real class is `nprcgenekeeprErr`), so its
  DB-failure branch never fired. The modular wiring uses `inherits(built, "nprcgenekeeprErr")` and
  drops the monolith's dead bare-`NULL` branch (`getFocalAnimalPed` only returns a data.frame or an
  errorLst).
- **Strict TDD** (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR, all gated + 2 pre-RED author-decision `AskUserQuestion`s — the
  owner-consult fork [mock-wire vs live-integration vs descope] → **mock-wire/full parity**): 2 new
  tests in `tests/testthat/test_modInput.R` drive `testServer(modInputServer)` and mock the LabKey seam
  via `testthat::local_mocked_bindings(getLkDirectRelatives = …, .package = "nprcgenekeepr")` so the
  real `getFocalAnimalPed` body runs (no live EHR). Both **RED at HEAD** (happy: `cleaned` NULL because
  the focal file is read as a 1-column pedigree; sad: `failedDatabaseConnection` never set), **GREEN**
  after. REFACTOR gated, skipped (minimal/idiomatic).
- **Verification:** `test_modInput.R` 0/0/0 (162 passed); full suite under `pkgload::load_all` +
  `NOT_CRAN=true` = **0 failed / 0 error**, 0 non-e2e offenders, e2e skipped (156), only the 5
  pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings (added zero), **2122 passed**. Lint **net-zero** on `R/modInput.R`
  (41 = 41, touched-file stash; explicit-`L` on the copied empty-warnings df), `document()` **zero**
  man/NAMESPACE delta, no macOS `* 2.*` dupes, **Phase-3E runtime smoke** — `runModularApp()` binds +
  HTTP 200, served HTML renders `dataInput-breederFile`/`-fileContent`/`-getData` + `value="focalAnimals"`.
  **Verification is environmentally limited** (no live EHR): the mock covers everything on the module's
  side of the ONPRC boundary; the live `getLkDirectRelatives` → `getDemographics` call is owner-verifiable
  only (stated, not skipped — not FM #24). **No NEWS bullet** — input-wiring/display parity for the
  modular app, no analytical-pipeline numeric change (consistent with S22/S23/S25).

### 2026-06-04 — Implement Phase 6 of the Shiny-module conversion: Breeding Groups parity B (Session 27)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** brought the modular **Breeding Group Formation** module to
  monolith parity for seed-group pre-seeding and the previously-inert formation controls, all in
  `R/modBreedingGroups.R` (plan §9 Phase 6):
  1. **Seed-group "current groups" widget** — a `seedGroups` checkbox reveals one per-group
     `textAreaInput` (`curGrp1..N`, count driven by `nGroups`). Their IDs build a length-`numGp`
     `currentGroups` list passed to `groupAddAssign()` in place of the hardcoded
     `list(character(0L))`, so groups can be pre-seeded (the monolith's `textAreaWidget`/
     `getCurrentGroups`, server.r:1019-1056).
  2. **Exposed three previously-inert controls** the server already read (`modBreedingGroups.R`
     L201-203) but no UI declared, so they had silently defaulted: `minAge` (numericInput, value 1),
     `nIterations` (numericInput, value 10L), `withKinship` (checkbox). The new control ids match the
     server reads (`minAge`/`nIterations`/`withKinship`), **not** the monolith's `gpIter`/`withKin`.
  3. **Breeding-sim iteration default `1000L → 10L`** — the modular fallback was a 100× drift from
     the monolith's `gpIter` (value=10L); now matches. This is a **real numeric change** to formed
     groups (the MIS sampler runs 100× fewer iterations by default).
- **Built robustly, not faithfully.** The monolith's `getCurrentGroups` is doubly buggy
  (`seq_along(input$numGp)` is a length-1 scalar → only `curGrp1` is ever read; `vapply(...)` yields
  a matrix not a list); the modular widget uses `seq_len(numGp)` so every group's textarea is honored
  (RED test asserts the 2nd seed group is honored). `length(currentGroups)` can never exceed `numGp`
  (built with `seq_len(numGp)` + truncation), so `groupAddAssign`'s length guard is unreachable.
- **More robust than the monolith — validate-and-block.** Seed IDs absent from the pedigree are
  rejected with a notification and formation aborts. Verified: a phantom seed otherwise survives into
  the group and **crashes** the Phase-5 Group Detail member view (`addSexAndAgeToGroup` →
  `getCurrentAge` on a length-0 birth). The monolith has only a partial `validate(need())` guard
  (server.r:1124-1133); the modular module previously had none.
- **Strict TDD** (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR, all gated + 4 pre-RED author-decision `AskUserQuestion`s):
  7 new tests — 5 RED at HEAD (UI controls present; `nIterations` renders `value="10"`; seeding lands
  animals in their group; multi-group seeding [proves the `curGrp1`-only bug not copied]; phantom seed
  blocks formation) + 2 green-at-HEAD coverage (blank-seed no-op; `withKinship=TRUE`→non-NULL kinship,
  green-at-HEAD because the server already reads `input$withKinship`). REFACTOR considered + skipped.
- **Verification:** `test_modBreedingGroups.R` 41 tests **0 failed / 0 error / 0 warning**; full suite
  under `pkgload::load_all` + `NOT_CRAN=true` **0 failed / 0 error**, e2e skipped (156), only the 5
  pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings. R6 validate-and-block guard **mutation-verified** (disabling it
  lets the phantom seed survive). Lint **net-zero** on `R/modBreedingGroups.R` (31 = 31, touched-file
  stash); `document()` zero man/NAMESPACE delta (`import(shiny)` covers the new controls); **Phase 3E
  runtime smoke** — `runModularApp()` HTTP 200 with `seedGroups`/`minAge`/`nIterations` (value 10)/
  `withKinship`/`seedTextareas` rendered and the Phase-5 Group Detail tab intact.
- A read-only 5-agent discovery + adversarial-completeness recon (`wf_e8e1176c-320`) confirmed the
  parity surface and sharpened the dragon (the phantom-seed crash); every load-bearing claim was
  verified firsthand.
- **Files:** `R/modBreedingGroups.R`, `tests/testthat/test_modBreedingGroups.R`. **Next: Phase 7**
  (focal-animal / LabKey pedigree build — risk HIGH 🐉, owner consult at phase start; see plan §9).

### 2026-06-04 — Implement Phase 5 of the Shiny-module conversion: Breeding Groups parity A (Session 26)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** brought the modular **Breeding Group Formation** module to
  monolith parity for the per-group display/export half, all in `R/modBreedingGroups.R` (plan §9
  Phase 5). A new **"Group Detail" tab** (additive — the existing all-groups "Groups" and
  "Statistics" tabs are untouched) adds:
  1. **`viewGrp` group selector** (`selectInput`), populated when groups form ("Group 1..N",
     with the last labelled "Unused" only when the appended unused-animals group is non-empty).
  2. **Per-group annotated member view** — `addSexAndAgeToGroup()` → rounded age → columns
     "Ego ID"/"Sex"/"Age in Years", ordered by ID (the monolith's `bgGroupView`).
  3. **Per-group kinship matrix view** — `filterKinMatrix(groupIds, kmat)` rounded to 6 dp
     (the monolith's `bgGroupKinView`).
  4. **`downloadGroup`** (member CSV, `na=""`/`row.names=FALSE`) and **`downloadGroupKin`**
     (kinship CSV, `na=""`/`row.names=TRUE`) handlers.
- **Dragon (threading the kinship matrix) discharged.** The kinship view computes each group's
  submatrix from the module's already-computed full `kmat` (now retained in `groupResults` with a
  `hasUnused` flag), NOT from `result$groupKin` (still NULL — `withKin` defaults FALSE until the
  Phase-6 `withKinship` control). This is **byte-identical** to the monolith's `groupKin[[i]]`
  (each group's members ⊆ candidates), and the group-**formation** compute path is **unchanged** —
  proven `identical()` across three `set.seed`ed scenarios (nGroups 3/4/1) vs a pre-change
  reference (`groups`/`score`/`unassigned`/`nGroups`). Display/download only.
- **More robust than the monolith.** Both views clamp `viewGrp` via
  `withinIntegerRange(., 1, length(breedingGroups()))` (the monolith clamps the member view to the
  *requested* `numGp` and leaves the kinship view unclamped — a latent out-of-range bug). The
  selector-populating `observe` guards on `length(breedingGroups()) >= 1L` (an empty result is a
  zero-length list, which `req()` treats as truthy — the naive guard warned on the degenerate
  harem-with-no-eligible-sires case).
- **TDD:** 5 new tests in `tests/testthat/test_modBreedingGroups.R` (UI structure; member-download
  content; kinship-download content + `filterKinMatrix`-equivalence; selector switches group;
  out-of-range clamp) — all red at HEAD, green after. Founders-with-birth fixture gives a
  deterministic kinship submatrix (0.5 diagonal / 0 off-diagonal); assertions key on the *actual*
  formed group. Full suite under `pkgload::load_all` + `NOT_CRAN=true`: **0 failed / 0 error**,
  156 e2e skipped, 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings, 2264 passed. Lint net-zero on
  `R/modBreedingGroups.R` (31 = 31); `document()` zero man/NAMESPACE delta; **Phase 3E runtime
  smoke** — `runModularApp()` HTTP 200 with the Group Detail tab + selector + downloads rendered.
- **Housekeeping:** removed two stray untracked macOS "filename 2" duplicates
  (`R/modBreedingGroups 2.R`, `tests/testthat/test_modBreedingGroups 2.R`) that had appeared
  mid-session and were doubling the generated `.Rd` docs and double-running the test file
  (moved aside to `/tmp`, not in git).
- **No `NEWS.md` bullet** — this is display/download parity for the not-yet-canonical modular app
  with no change to the analytical pipeline (NEWS is reserved for numeric changes + the Phase 9
  deprecation). Plan §9 Phase 5 → DONE; next is Phase 6 (seed-groups + inert controls).

### 2026-06-04 — Implement Phase 4 of the Shiny-module conversion: genotype file merge in modInput (Session 25)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** brought the modular **Data Input** module to monolith parity
  for the **separate pedigree/genotype** upload path, all in `R/modInput.R` (plan §9 Phase 4).
  1. **Genotype file merge.** Inside `observeEvent(input$getData)`, before the `qcStudbook`/
     `runQcStudbook` calls, the `separatePedGenoFile` path now reads `input$genotypeFile` via
     `getGenotypes()`, validates with `checkGenotypeFile()` (degrading to no-merge on
     warning/error, mirroring the monolith), and merges it into the raw pedigree via
     `addGenotype()`. The integer `first`/`second` columns then ride the cleaned studbook into
     `reportGV()` (via `getGVGenotype()`/`hasGenotype()`), so genome-uniqueness uses the real
     genotypes. Previously `activeFile()` silently dropped `input$genotypeFile`.
  2. **`genotypeData()` populated.** Added `genotype = getGVGenotype(qcResult$cleaned)` to the
     module's stored results, so the `genotypeData()` reactive (formerly always NULL) returns the
     id/first/second extract (NULL when no genotype, preserving the prior contract).
  3. **More robust than the monolith.** The merge is **NULL-guarded** — `addGenotype(ped, NULL)`
     crashes (`"'by' must specify a uniquely valid column"`), a latent unguarded crash in the
     monolith; a malformed genotype file now degrades to no-merge instead of crashing the QC run.
  - **Common-mode unchanged (proven at parity):** neither app integer-codes string allele names
    for a combined ped+genotype file, so common-mode genotypes never reach `reportGV`'s gene-drop
    in either app — adding `addGenotype` to the common branch would be a behavior change beyond
    parity. Phase 4 touches only the `separatePedGenoFile` path.
- **Tests:** 2 new tests in `tests/testthat/test_modInput_qcStudbook.R` — a discriminating
  happy-path (upload the shipped `obfuscated_rhesus_mhc_ped.csv` + `…_breeder_genotypes.csv`;
  assert the cleaned studbook gains `first`/`second`, `hasGenotype()` TRUE, `genotypeData()`
  populated) and a malformed-genotype graceful-degradation test (NULL-guard mutation-verified).
- **Method (TDD, ultracode):** RED→GREEN→REFACTOR with all gates + 2 pre-RED author decisions via
  `AskUserQuestion` (populate `genotypeData()` too; reader = `getGenotypes()`); a 5-agent
  read-only discovery + adversarial-completeness recon (`wf_37c91d78-d24`) settled the
  common-mode/NULL-crash/testServer-harness questions, all verified firsthand.
- **Verification:** full suite under `pkgload::load_all` + `NOT_CRAN=true` = 0 failed / 0 error,
  0 non-e2e offenders, 2085 passed, e2e skipped (156); lint net-zero on `R/modInput.R` (41 = 41);
  `devtools::document()` no man/NAMESPACE delta; **Phase 3E runtime smoke** `runModularApp()`
  binds + HTTP 200 (modInput mounts with the `genotypeFile` input). No NEWS bullet (modular app
  not yet canonical; no analytical-pipeline numeric change).
- **Files:** `R/modInput.R`, `tests/testthat/test_modInput_qcStudbook.R`. **Next: Phase 5**
  (Breeding Groups downloads + per-group kinship + group selector).

### 2026-06-04 — Implement Phase 3 of the Shiny-module conversion: GVA genome-uniqueness threshold + subset/filter export (Session 24)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** brought the modular **Genetic Value Analysis** tab to
  monolith parity across four verified gaps, all in `R/modGeneticValue.R` (plan §9 Phase 3).
  1. **Genome-uniqueness threshold control.** Added a `selectInput(ns("threshold"))` (choices
     1–5, default 4) threaded via a new `guThreshold()` reactive into `reportGV()`, replacing the
     hard-coded `guThresh = 1L`. This changes default genome-uniqueness output for the modular
     app (intended parity — the monolith default is the threaded integer 4).
  2. **Subset/filter view.** Added a `viewIds` textarea + "Filter View" button + a `gvaView()`
     reactive that filters the report by entered IDs via the exported `filterReport()` (monolith
     `gvaView`/`filterReport`, server.r:462-477); the rankings table now reflects the filter.
  3. **Export Subset.** Added `downloadGVASubset` (writes the filtered view, `na=""`); relabeled
     the existing `downloadRankings` "Download" → "Export All" to pair with it.
  4. **Gene-drop iterations default** 5000 → 1000 (monolith parity); **removed** the inert
     `minAge` slider (never read; no monolith GVA counterpart).
- **Author decisions (USER, via `AskUserQuestion`):** direct threshold mapping (choices 1–5,
  default 4 — drops the monolith's confusing label-offset while keeping the threaded integer 4);
  iterations default 1000; remove minAge only (the 2 sibling inert checkboxes
  `calcGenomeUniqueness`/`calcMeanKinship` deferred); whole Phase 3 in one session.
- **TDD:** strict RED→GREEN→REFACTOR with phase gates (each via `AskUserQuestion`). 6 new
  discriminating tests in `tests/testthat/test_modGeneticValue.R`; minAge removal in REFACTOR
  deleted 2 tautological tests + 3 assertion lines (no real coverage lost — they only echoed the
  inert input back).
- **Discriminating-RED traps (verify-first, Learnings #15/#20):** (a) no existing test pinned the
  threshold, so all pass on the buggy `guThresh=1L` — the RED keys on the threaded integer via an
  internal `guThreshold()` reactive (empirically guThresh 1 vs 4 changes every `gu` row); (b) the
  flipped iterations assertion `grepl("1000")` first PASSED on the bug because `max="10000"`
  contains "1000" — re-keyed on the rendered `value="1000"` attribute.
- **Recon:** a read-only discovery + adversarial-completeness workflow (`wf_a1f5fdb4-b8e`, 4
  agents) re-derived the parity surface and flagged three implementation blockers, all verified
  firsthand: `%||%` is not portable (not in shiny/this package; base only since R 4.4) → used an
  explicit `is.null` guard; `stri_trim` is not the imported symbol (`stri_trim_both` is) → used
  base `trimws`; `import(shiny)` (NAMESPACE:168) covers the new `selectInput`/`textAreaInput`.
- **Verification:** `test_modGeneticValue.R` 53/53; full suite under `pkgload::load_all` +
  `NOT_CRAN=true` = 0 failed / 0 error, 0 non-e2e offenders, e2e skipped (156), 5 pre-existing
  `modPyramid` warnings; lint net-zero on `R/modGeneticValue.R` (HEAD 23 = NOW 23, via
  touched-file stash); `document()` no man/NAMESPACE delta; Phase 3E runtime smoke —
  `runModularApp()` binds + HTTP 200, the new threshold/viewIds/Export-Subset controls render and
  the minAge slider is gone. NEWS bullet added (the plan reserves NEWS for this numeric change).
  Commit `280d1df0` (impl) + the `docs:` close-out.

### 2026-06-03 — Implement Phase 2 of the Shiny-module conversion: wire the GvAndBgDesc description tab (Session 23)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** mounted the already-built `modGvAndBgDesc` module as a navbar
  tab so the modular app gains the monolith's **Genetic Value Analysis and Breeding Group
  Description** tab (plan §9 Phase 2).
  - `R/appUI.R`: a `tabPanel` after "Breeding Groups" (monolith-parity placement, per
    `inst/application/ui.r`) calling `modGvAndBgDescUI("gvAndBgDesc")`.
  - `R/appServer.R`: `modGvAndBgDescServer("gvAndBgDesc")` (informational module — returns NULL,
    no reactive state).
- **TDD:** strict RED→GREEN (REFACTOR skipped — author decision; the change is minimal/idiomatic).
  Two new integration tests in `tests/testthat/test_modGvAndBgDesc.R`.
- **Discriminating-RED gotcha (verify-first, Learning #15/#20/#23):** the module's H3 heading
  ("Genetic Value Analysis and Breeding Group Description") is NOT a discriminating marker —
  `genetic_value.html`, already mounted by `modGeneticValue`, contains that exact phrase, so a
  naive heading assertion is a tautology that passes at HEAD. The discriminating marker is
  `gvAndBgDesc.html`'s own body text (`"kinship coefficients"` / `"genetic value analysis
  proceeds"`), unique among the mounted guidance HTML and absent from `appUI()` at HEAD.
  (`modGvAndBgDescUI` does not call `NS()`, so there is no namespaced container to assert on —
  the included content IS the mount marker.)
- **Verification:** `test_modGvAndBgDesc.R` 10/10, `test_appServer_dynamicTabs.R` 23/23 (the
  dynamic insert/remove-tab interaction is unaffected — the new tab is far from the "Input"
  insert target); full suite under `pkgload::load_all` + `NOT_CRAN=true` = 0 failed / 0 error,
  2073 passed (+2), e2e skipped (156), 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings; lint net-zero
  (appUI 0=0, appServer 18=18); `document()` no man/NAMESPACE delta; Phase 3E runtime smoke —
  `runModularApp()` binds + HTTP 200. Commit `ef6a9f4c`.
- **NEWS deferred** to the Phase 9 canonical switch (modular app not yet canonical).

### 2026-06-03 — Implement Phase 1 of the Shiny-module conversion: Summary Statistics tab parity (Session 22)
- **Deliverable (implementation):** brought the modular app's **Summary Statistics tab**
  (`R/modSummaryStats.R`) to legacy-monolith parity across four verified gaps (plan §9 Phase 1):
  1. **Z-score plots** now render. `reportGV()` emits the column `zScores` (plural), but
     `modSummaryStats` checked `zScore` (singular) — so the z-score histogram + boxplot were
     always NULL ("Z-scores not available"). Fixed with a dual-name lookup (prefer `zScores`,
     fall back to `zScore`), matching `modGeneticValue`'s existing `indivMeanKin`/`meanKinship`
     idiom. (Real column name confirmed empirically before the fix.)
  2. **Mean-Kinship / Genome-Uniqueness quartile tables** (Min/1st-Q/Mean/Median/3rd-Q/Max)
     rendered on the Summary tab (monolith `server.r:545-630`); previously only 3 scalars showed.
  3. **Founder table** (Known/Female/Male counts + FE + FG) rendered on the Summary tab
     (monolith `server.r:558-570`) by threading `modGeneticValue`'s `founderStats` reactive into
     `modSummaryStatsServer` (new `founderStats` param; wired in `R/appServer.R`).
  4. **Kinship-matrix download** fixed: was a dead button (`req()` on a NULL `kinshipMatrix`
     arg with `appServer.R` passing `NULL`); now writes the module's internal `getKinshipMatrix()`.
- **TDD:** strict RED→GREEN (REFACTOR skipped — author decision). New discriminating tests in
  `tests/testthat/test_modSummaryStats_parity.R` (6 tests / 22 expectations); the z-score test
  uses ONLY the real `zScores` column so it fails on the singular-name bug — a pre-existing
  `_ggplots` test passed on the bug because its fixture injects both names (Learning #15/#20).
- **Author decisions (`AskUserQuestion`):** founder table → add to Summary tab (keep GVA subtab);
  kinship download → use the module's internal kinship (smallest change, no relationship-basis
  change — avoided the plan's "thread reportGV kinship" dragon).
- **Verification:** full suite under `pkgload::load_all` + `NOT_CRAN=true` = 0 failed / 0 error,
  2071 passed (+22), e2e skipped; lint net-zero (modSummaryStats 60=60, appServer 18=18);
  `devtools::document()` (only `man/modSummaryStatsServer.Rd`); runtime smoke — `runModularApp()`
  binds + HTTP 200. NEWS deferred to the Phase 9 canonical switch (modular app not yet canonical).
- **Files:** `R/modSummaryStats.R`, `R/appServer.R`, `man/modSummaryStatsServer.Rd`,
  `tests/testthat/test_modSummaryStats_parity.R`. Plan: `docs/planning/shiny-module-conversion-plan.md` §9 Phase 1.

### 2026-06-02 — PLAN: complete the Shiny-module conversion (XARCH-1 / issue #27) (Session 21)
- **Deliverable (planning, not implementation):** `docs/planning/shiny-module-conversion-plan.md`
  — a 9-phase, vertical-slice plan to declare the modular app (`runModularApp`/`appUI`/
  `appServer`/`mod*`) canonical, reach feature parity with the legacy monolith
  (`inst/application/`), enable the shinytest2 E2E tier, then delete the monolith and make
  `runGeneKeepR()` a `lifecycle::deprecate_soft` alias. Followed the ARCHITECTURE workstream +
  the SESSION_RUNNER Planning protocol (evidence-based grep inventory, per-phase done-criteria,
  vertical slices). The project's first planning/architecture deliverable.
- **Method:** a read-only 8-mapper discovery workflow + firsthand verification of every
  load-bearing claim + a 3-agent completeness-critic that caught 4 real parity gaps the
  single-pass synthesis missed (dead kinship-download button; dropped MK/GU quartile tables;
  FE/FG founder-table placement; a 100× breeding-`gpIter` default drift).
- **Author scope decisions (via `AskUserQuestion`):** full conversion (parity + E2E + retire);
  exclude ORIP/Settings (parity = match the monolith); re-expose the GU-threshold selector
  (default 4).
- **Key findings (reframe the audit):** the modular app is far more complete than
  `TECH_DEBT_AUDIT_2026-05-30.md` implied; the audit's "do XARCH-3/4/7 before XARCH-1"
  sequencing is moot (verified); the E2E suite is unwritten scaffolding (its driver helpers are
  defined nowhere) — this is the real scope of issue #39; issue #34 ("integrate qcStudbook in
  modInput") is stale (already integrated). No code changed this session.
- **Next:** implement **Phase 1 only** (Summary Statistics tab parity) under strict TDD.

### 2026-06-02 — Fix vacuous "no potential parent" assertion in `test_getPotentialParents.R` (Session 20)
- **Defect (found Session 4, fixed now):** the test "works with records with no
  potential parent" pushed BRI2MW's birth to 1950 into a local `ped` but then
  asserted the old top-level `potentialParents[[1L]]$id` from the *unmodified*
  fixture — a tautology already covered by the first test that never inspected
  `ped` and verified nothing about its named scenario (copy/paste slip).
- **Fix (REFACTOR-only under strict TDD; no production change):** replace the
  assertion with a discriminating one. BRI2MW is a from-center founder with both
  parents unknown that normally appears in the output; with its birth at 1950 its
  breeding-age candidate set is empty, so `getPotentialParents` correctly drops it
  via the no-breeding-age-candidate skip. The test now asserts BRI2MW is present
  in the unmodified fixture (precondition), absent from the scenario result, and
  that the result has exactly one fewer entry (50 → 49).
- **Why REFACTOR-only:** `getPotentialParents` is already correct, so a correct
  assertion is green-on-arrival; strict TDD forbids declaring RED on a passing
  test, and forcing a fail with a wrong expectation would be a synthetic RED
  (Learning #18c). Rigor instead came from a mutation check: disabling the skip
  makes both new assertions fail, proving the test discriminates (the old
  assertion passed against that same mutant).
- **Verification:** full suite under `load_all` + `NOT_CRAN=true`: **0 failed /
  0 error**, zero non-e2e offenders, **2049 passed** (+2 vs Session 19), 5
  pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings, e2e files skipped. Commit `6049445d`.

### 2026-06-02 — Resolve the E2E test-infra debt: add `create_test_app()` with an opt-in gate (Session 19)
- **Root cause:** the 23 `test-app-*`/`test-e2e-*` files call `create_test_app()`
  at **154 sites**, but the helper was never defined (it never existed in git
  history; the e2e scaffolding landed in `7da01afe` without it). Result: **154
  suite ERRORS** under `devtools::test()`/CI (`NOT_CRAN=true`), masked only by
  `skip_on_cran()` under a bare `testthat::test_dir()` — a suite that was clean
  or broken depending on the runner.
- **Fix (strict TDD, RED→GREEN; no REFACTOR needed):** define `create_test_app()`
  in `tests/testthat/helper-shinytest2.R`. It **skips** the calling test unless
  `NPRC_RUN_E2E=true`, and when opted in returns the existing `inst/shinytest`
  app dir (`app.R` = `shinyApp(appUI(), appServer)`) for `shinytest2::AppDriver`.
  The browser E2E suite stays **opt-in** (slow, needs Chrome, and depends on the
  modular-vs-monolith consolidation, XARCH-1) but is now one env var away from
  running; the default suite is honestly clean (154 errors → skips).
- **Discovery:** the prior E2E effort was ~90% complete, not lost scaffolding —
  the app is instrumented (`data-ready.js` + all six modules signal readiness),
  159 `test_that` blocks + wait/upload helpers + `.github/workflows/shinytest2.yaml`
  CI all exist; only `create_test_app()` was missing. Captured the remaining
  campaign (validate the 159 tests; wire CI; sequence with XARCH-1) as **GitHub
  issue #39** so the plan can't be lost again.
- **Verification:** new browser-free `tests/testthat/test_create_test_app.R` (opt-in
  returns app dir; gate raises a `skip` condition). Full suite under `load_all` +
  `NOT_CRAN=true`: **0 failed / 0 error**, 154 e2e errors → skips, zero non-e2e
  offenders, 2047 passed, 5 pre-existing `modPyramid` warnings. Lint net-zero
  (helper-shinytest2.R = 0 in-place). No `document()` (test helper, not package API).
- Commits: `a1ee8497` (test: helper + tests), + this `docs:` close-out.

### 2026-06-01 — Document the Mendelian ½ factor; drop the dead UID.founders block (NEW-22/NEW-30, Session 18)
- **NEW-22 (Mendelian ½ "hardcoded in 5 places"):** Session 17's NEW-13/NEW-23
  consolidation already removed the `calcFE`/`calcFG`/`calcFEFG` triplication, so
  the remaining `/ 2L` sites are *distinct* Mendelian formulas (parental-
  contribution average, parental-kinship average, self-kinship `(1+f)/2`, founder
  self-kinship init), **not** duplicated logic. Per the package author's decision
  the self-documenting literals are kept and a one-line Mendelian-½ comment is
  added at each site in `calcFounderContributions.R` and `kinship.R`; **no** named
  constant — one would over-couple distinct formulas across the GV compute and the
  kinship engine.
- **NEW-30 (dead/unused computed variables):** removed the genuinely-dead
  `## UID.founders <- …` commented block (and its `# nolint: commented_code_linter`
  wrapper) from `calcFounderContributions.R`. **Kept** `founderMatrix <- NULL` — it
  is an intentional memory free (drops the founders×founders identity block before
  the generation loop), not a dead variable as the audit claimed — now annotated.
- Comment + dead-code only; **zero behavior change**, proven byte-`identical()` on
  `calcFE`/`calcFG`/`calcFEFG` (character+factor), `calcFounderContributions` `$p`
  and `$ped`, `kinship()` dense+sparse, and the full `set.seed(42)` `reportGV()`
  object. Full suite under `load_all`: 0 failed / 0 error, 2001 passed; lint
  net-zero on both files; `document()` produced no man/NAMESPACE change. No
  `NEWS.md` entry — the change is internal-only with no user-facing effect.

### 2026-06-01 — Consolidate calcFE/calcFG/calcFEFG founder-contribution code (NEW-13/NEW-23, Session 17)
- The founder-contribution algorithm that `calcFE()`, `calcFG()`, and
  `calcFEFG()` shared near-verbatim (~45 lines each), together with the
  triplicated Session-7 partial-parentage `stop()` guard, now lives once in a
  new `@noRd` helper `calcFounderContributions(ped, caller)` that returns
  `list(p, ped)`. The three functions become thin wrappers (net -118 lines).
- Behaviour-preserving with no public-API change: signatures, return types, and
  the per-function error messages are byte-identical, and `calcFE()` stays
  gene-drop-free. Proven `identical()` on FE/FG over lacy1989Ped (character AND
  factor), the full `set.seed(42)` `reportGV()` object (the live `calcFEFG`
  caller), and all three guard messages; independently re-verified by a 3-agent
  adversarial equivalence workflow (static body-diff, 20 empirical OLD-vs-NEW
  edge tests, contract/guard/namespace) with 0 divergences.
- Full suite under `load_all`: 0 failed / 0 error, 2001 passed (+10 helper
  assertions). Lint net-zero; no man/NAMESPACE churn (`@noRd`).
- Out of scope (sibling audit items, not opted into): NEW-22 (hardcoded
  Mendelian 1/2), NEW-30 (dead vars - the `UID.founders` comment block was
  relocated intact), NEW-29/61 (founder-definition `^U` handling).
- Done under strict TDD (RED->GREEN->REFACTOR). Commits: `022afc8b` (helper +
  tests, GREEN), `2b27f4c3` (thin wrappers, REFACTOR), plus this close-out.

### 2026-06-01 — Extract getFounders()/isFounder() founder-detection helpers (PED-1/NEW-17, Session 16)
- Added two exported helper functions that define the founder predicate (an
  animal whose sire and dam are both unknown) in a single place:
  `isFounder(ped)` returns the logical mask `is.na(ped$sire) & is.na(ped$dam)`,
  and `getFounders(ped)` returns `ped$id[isFounder(ped)]`.
- Replaced the inline founder-detection idiom at 12 call sites across 9 files:
  `getFounders()` in `calcFE()`, `calcFEFG()`, `calcFG()`, `calcRetention()`,
  `orderReport()`, and `removeUninformativeFounders()`; `isFounder()` for the
  founder-row subset in `reportGV()`, the male/female founder exports in
  `modSummaryStats` (×2), and the founder counts in `modORIPReporting` (×4).
  `findPedigreeNumber()` was left as-is: it operates on bare `id`/`sire`/`dam`
  vectors with no `ped` object, so the `ped`-argument helpers do not fit it.
  `calcRetention()`'s adjacent `descendants` line was deliberately untouched —
  it alone filters by `ped$population`.
- Behaviour-preserving by construction and verified empirically: every
  refactored output proven `identical()` to a pre-refactor reference — the four
  `calc*` functions on the lacy1989 fixture, the full seeded `reportGV()` output,
  and the Shiny-module expressions on the qcPed fixture. Full suite
  0 failed / 0 error / 1991 passed; lint net-zero on all 11 files (the two new
  files and the seven compute files are lint-free; the two Shiny modules carry
  only pre-existing style debt, count unchanged between HEAD~1 and HEAD).
- An independent 4-angle completeness sweep (read-only workflow) re-derived the
  founder-detection inventory and converged on a single remaining inline site —
  `findPedigreeNumber.R:35`, the intentional exclusion — confirming no `R/` site
  was missed.
- Done under strict TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR). Commits: `2758ffe6` (helpers +
  tests + NAMESPACE + man), `77f13d51` (calc* + orderReport), `a95828d6`
  (reportGV + removeUninformativeFounders + Shiny modules), plus this close-out.

### 2026-06-01 — Fix lower-quartile mislabel + bind-once refactor in summarizeKinshipValues (NEW-16, Session 15)
- Fixed NEW-16: `summarizeKinshipValues()` reported the `secondQuartile` column
  as `fivenum()[1]` (the minimum) instead of `fivenum()[2]` (the lower hinge),
  so the lower-quartile column silently duplicated `min`. It affected 5 of 153
  rows in the documented example pipeline. As with NEW-45, the audit's mechanism
  and prescribed fix were both correct; the pre-existing test happened to pass on
  the buggy output (its row-10 lower hinge equals that row's min), so a new
  synthetic test (`numbers = 1:5`, where the lower hinge 2 ≠ the min 1) was added
  to detect the mislabel. Fixed by `tukeys[1L]` → `tukeys[2L]`
  (`R/summarizeKinshipValues.R:106`); `thirdQuartile` (the upper hinge) was
  already correct.
- Refactored the O(n²) `rbind`-in-loop into a preallocated row list bound once
  with `do.call(rbind, …)` (O(n)). Proven behaviour-preserving: `identical()`
  output on the seeded example pipeline, the synthetic input, and the
  all-skipped/empty case (which still returns an empty `data.frame()`).
- Decision (author): `R/makeGeneticDiversityDashboard.R` (NEW-20) is **retained**
  as early-development work rather than deleted. It is already excluded from the
  package build via `.Rbuildignore` and defines no live function, so NEW-20 is
  closed as won't-delete (not the audit's "delete dead code"). A whitespace-only
  comment realignment in that file was committed first (`926f4606`).

### 2026-06-01 — Reject duplicate animal IDs in geneDrop (NEW-46, Session 14)
- Fixed NEW-46: `geneDrop()` crashed with the cryptic base-R error
  "duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed" (at `rownames(ped) <- ids`,
  `geneDrop.R:97`) when given duplicate animal ids — before any allele logic
  ran. The audit's "parent lookup by rowname; duplicate ids → wrong values" was
  empirically a hard crash, not silent corruption, and at the rownames
  assignment rather than the lookup (the NEW-48 pattern: audit mechanism wrong).
- Added an upfront guard (alongside the NEW-45 period guard) that rejects
  duplicate ids with a clear, actionable message ("animal IDs must be unique;
  duplicated id(s): …"), consistent with `kinship()` ("All id values must be
  unique") and `removeDuplicates()`. The unique-id invariant is a domain rule.
- Reachability was direct-`geneDrop()`-call only: the canonical
  `qcStudbook → reportGV → geneDrop` path is doubly masked — `removeDuplicates()`
  (qcStudbook) and `kinship()`'s own unique-id guard (called in `reportGV` before
  `geneDrop`). So no reportGV change was needed.
- Contract-preserving: today's behavior is already a crash, so no
  currently-succeeding call changes — only the diagnostic improves (Learning #8b).
- Strict TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR). Full suite 0 failed / 0 error / 1971 passed;
  lint net-zero; `man/geneDrop.Rd` regenerated; no NAMESPACE change.

### 2026-05-31 — Enforce "no period in IDs" rule (NEW-45, Session 13)
- Fixed NEW-45: `geneDrop()` silently corrupted allele assignment for any `id`
  containing a period (".") — it rebuilt the id/parent columns by splitting
  flattened data.frame rownames on ".", so a period-bearing id was truncated and
  lost its sire/dam distinction. The documented ID domain forbids "."
  (`inst/extdata/ui_guidance/input_format.html`: id/sire/dam are "Alphanumeric
  characters (no symbols)").
- Enforced the rule rather than re-engineering `geneDrop` to support periods.
  New internal `hasInvalidIdChar()` defines the rule once and is used by:
  `qcStudbook()` (rejects period-bearing `id`/`sire`/`dam` at data input —
  `stop()` in default mode, `errorLst$invalidIdChars` when `reportErrors = TRUE`)
  and `geneDrop()` (defense-in-depth `stop()` for callers that bypass
  `qcStudbook`, e.g. the genetic-value Shiny module). Auto-generated IDs
  (`addUIds` `U####`, `obfuscateId`) are already period-free; locked with tests.
- Documented the feature with rationale (periods break across software
  environments) in roxygen, the live `input_format.html` spec, and `NEWS`.
- Strict TDD (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR). Full suite 0 failed / 0 error / 1961 passed;
  lint 0. Code commit `5e228bd9` (fix) + docs commit.

### 2026-05-31 — Methodology framework update (Session 10)
- Updated the embedded methodology to canonical `rmsharp/methodology` `f32d780`: synced
  `SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `SAFEGUARDS.md`, and `methodology_dashboard.py` byte-identical to
  canonical via `bin/sync`.
- Refreshed `docs/methodology/` framework docs (`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`,
  `HOW_TO_USE.md`, `README.md`) and workstreams; added 4 new upstream workstreams
  (`INHERITED_CODEBASE_FAMILIARIZATION_CAMPAIGN`, `RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM`,
  `RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN`, `TEMPLATE_CAMPAIGN`).
- Relocated the 10 project Learnings (from `SESSION_RUNNER.md`) and the R-package
  build-equivalent (from `SAFEGUARDS.md`) into `CLAUDE.md`'s "Project-Specific
  Methodology Adaptations" and "Build / Test / Verify" sections, so the synced files
  stay byte-identical to canonical.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`; split `BACKLOG.md`
  (completed work → here; feature inventory → `ROADMAP.md`).

### 2026-05-30 – 2026-05-31 — PED/GV audit-fix campaign (Sessions 1–9, strict TDD)
- **Audits produced:** `TECH_DEBT_AUDIT_2026-05-30.md` (Session 1, read-only) and
  `PED_GV_AUDIT_2026-05-30.md` (Session 2 — re-audit of the PED & GV clusters;
  61 confirmed / 2 refuted findings).
- **Correctness bugs fixed** (each test-first under strict TDD, with regression tests):
  - NEW-15 — `countKinshipValues` wrong loop index corrupted accumulated kinship counts
    (the audit's only HIGH-severity bug). `b05133ca`
  - NEW-34 — `getPotentialParents` unbound-`j` crash when `pUnknown` is empty. `dc695a3b`
  - NEW-40 — `findGeneration` returned silent NA generations on cyclic pedigrees;
    now warns at the choke point. `ea5d28fa`
  - NEW-37 — `correctParentSex` silently overwrote recorded H/U parent sex to M/F. `6b0ae333`
  - NEW-48 — `calcFEFG`/`calcFE`/`calcFG` crashed on partial parentage; now a clear
    `stop()`. `19350559`
  - NEW-25 — `getProportionLow` crashed on empty input; now a clear `stop()`. `587ba042`
  - NEW-52 — `cumulateSimKinships` standard deviation undefined for n<2: n=1 → NA matrix +
    warning, n<1 → clear `stop()`. (Audit's catastrophic-cancellation mechanism empirically
    disproved as unreachable for dyadic-rational kinship values.) `e3c7e8b3`
