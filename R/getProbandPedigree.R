#' Filters a pedigree down to only the ancestors of the provided group,
#' removing unnecessary individuals from the studbook. This version builds
#' the pedigree back in time starting from a group of probands. This will
#' include all ancestors of the probands, even ones that might be
#' uninformative.
#'
#' @return A reduced pedigree.
#'
#' @param probands a character vector with the list of animals whose ancestors
#' should be included in the final pedigree.
#' @param ped datatable that is the `Pedigree`. It contains pedigree
#' information. The fields \code{sire} and \code{dam} are required.
