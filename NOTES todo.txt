Need to compare what trimPedigree() does to getPedDirectRelatives()
Study simulatedKvalues with partial parentage (simulatedKValues.Rmd);
  ensure it is being displayed as an article.
Ran from terminal to find files in R directory that do not have "@return"
rmsharp$ grep -L "@return" *
Add to test coverage: found should be able to add to tests for /
 fixColumnNames.R, summarizeKinshipValues.R, saveDataframesAsFiles.R,
 makeExamplePedigreeFile.R, maybe rankSubjects.R, getPotentialParents.R,
 perhaps groupAddAssign.R
Check for error in dataframe2string.R where NROWS is all caps.
