\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Mark presented progress on countKinshipValues.R, which is still had a
  minor error, which was corrected after the meeting.
\item
  Matt had already sent a large a deidentified rhesus pedigree that Mark
  was able to locate. Once Matt has provided a file with potential
  parents, Mark can use it to test the code with large files. Changes to
  allow large pedigrees and large simulations are expected. Currently
  with small pedigrees simulations of \textgreater{} 100,000 iterations
  are possible.
\item
  Matt presented ideas regarding updating of the current website. Much
  of the basic material is still accurate but information regarding
  installation and running the application is dated.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Instructions on creating the pedigrees should be largely correct,
    however, use of Excel files and LabKey are missing from the
    instructions.
  \item
    There is a need to add some short instructional videos with the idea
    that the subjects be very specific and the videos be less than three
    minutes long.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  After the meeting, Mark corrected the countKinshipValues functions,
  added a set of unit tests for the function, and added over 20 more
  unit tests to eight other functions. Current coverage is just over
  95\%.
\item
  A clean build: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes with updated website
  pages will be uploaded. However, since this is on the issue8
  development branch, it should not affect the current GitHub website.
\item
  Mark made \textbf{summarizeKinshipValues} that uses the output of
  \textbf{countKinshipValues} to return a dataframe of summary
  statistics
\item
  Mark is to make a function to create histograms of the simulated
  kinship values. This function is of low priority.
\end{enumerate}

  Preparation notes

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Mark has not created the function to create the Tukey five number
    summary.
  \item
    Mark has created \textbf{createSimKinships} that uses
    \textbf{make\_SimPed} and \textbf{kinship} makes a list object of
    kinship matrices from simulated pedigrees of possible parents for
    animals with unknown parents.
  \item
    Mark has created \textbf{cumulateSimKinships}, which makes a list
    object of kinship matrices from simulated pedigrees of possible
    parents for animals with unknown parents.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Discussed issue 8 - adding fromCenter to calculate unknown parents
  kinship value

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Matt to work on function to find potential sires and dams for
    animals lacking parents to be used in the kinship simulation,
    \textbf{kinship.R}.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Only object needed by the function is \textbf{ped}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Matt to work on a function to find animals born here but lack
    parents.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The function will create a list object with three vectors of IDs:
      animals missing both parents, animals missing the dam, and animals
      missing the sire.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Matt to work on a function to find parents for those identified
    above

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Use ped, list, argument
    \item
      Argument:

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Sires with any offspring within plus or minus 1 yr of birth.
      \item
        Dams with any offspring within plus or minus 1 yr of birth but
        did not have an offspring in focal birth year. This will work
        for rhesus but needs to be made so that the exclusion period is
        variable. For example, potential baboon dams would need to be
        excluded if they had an offspring within 6 months of birth.
        Thus, the plus or minus period needs to be an optional parameter
        with a default ot 1 year and the dam exclusion period should
        default to the gestational length for the species.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Matt to work on a function to put them together into a list object
    \textbf{allSimParents} made up of lists where the internal list has
    the offspring ID (\textbf{id}), a vector of representative sires
    (\textbf{sires}), and a vector of representative dams
    (\textbf{dams}). In those cases where the sire or dam is known the
    vector will contain the known respective sire or dam ID.
  \item
    Mark to create a function (\textbf{makeSimPed()}) to use the list
    object of \textbf{allSimParents} to make the simulated pedigree
    along with the associated unit tests.
  \item
    Mark will create a function to run the simulation. It will take the
    \textbf{allSimParents} and use \textbf{makeSimPed()} to create a
    list of simulated kinship matrices. If memory becomes an issue,
    summary statistics will have to be accumulated. The simmulated
    kinship coefficients for any one animal will be normally destributed
    so this is straight forward.
  \item
    Mark will create a function to take the simulated kinship matrices
    and generate Tukey's five number summary for each.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Mark and Matt met with the Genetics and Genomics Consortium to present
  a brief summary of work to date and to discuss potential work going
  forward.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Provided a table of statistics describing the growth of the software
    from a set of 8 scripts to a mature package published on CRAN.
  \item
    Near term plans

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Plans to correctly handle false founders made up of animals from
      within the colony that do not have one or both parents identified.
    \item
      Offered to help with LabKey integration at each site using LabKey.
    \item
      Offered to train users and improve tutorials based on user
      feedback.
    \item
      Will refactor user interface code to use Shiny modules.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Parent exclusion software

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Nearly done with conversion of Java scripts to R
    \item
      Plan to make standalone Shiny Application
    \item
      May integrate into \texttt{nprcgenekeepr}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Possible long term plan is to provide predictive modeling of
    breeding strategies via simulation.
  \item
    Obtained requests from users

    \begin{enumerate}

    \tightlist
    \item
      ARMS connectivity
    \item

    \item
      Add tracking of individual alleles

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\arabic{enumiv}.}
      \tightlist
      \item
        The internal code already does this if the animal has geneotypes
        assigned. However, the user interface is minimal and does not
        provide output regarding statistical summaries of probabilities
        for those individual genes being in the current potential
        breeders.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      Group from common colony - assign kinship coefficients (matrix)
      based on genetic data. Mark does not remember the meaning of this
      request and needs to find someone who can provide more
      explanation.

  Submission to CRAN was rejected with the following revision requests

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    considerably reduce the check time of your package to stay below the
    threshold of 10 minutes. This can for example be achieved by:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Omitting the less important and lengthy tests by only running them
      conditionally if some environment variable is set that you only
      define on your machine.
    \item
      Using precomputed results for the computational intensive parts in
      vignettes.
    \item
      Ensure that even after this change the package still includes
      illustrative examples of the use of the user-facing functions.
      Please aim at trying to test and also illustrate the use of as
      much functionality of the package as possible while making
      considerate use of the computational resources.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Single quotes are used to mark non-English usage, package names,
    software names, API names and paper titles. Not for names or
    abbreviations/acronyms. Please omit them where not accurate,
    e.g.~--\textgreater{} Raboin, API,\ldots{}
  \item
    Please only capitalize names, sentence beginnings and
    abbreviations/acronyms in the description text of your DESCRIPTION
    file. e.g.~-- electronic health records

\item
  Is the tutorial for CRAN or the Consortium users. need overview of tab
  structure and order (left to right).

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Notes regarding feedback from Amanda on 20200204 I am willing to
    change ``reading'' to ``uploading'', but they do not mean the same
    thing. When you upload a file, there is no inference of paying
    attention to the contents. When reading a file, the contents are
    examined. Reading is the more accurate descriptor in our case.

    I am going to write a separate tutorial explicitly for the
    consortium members as typical R users would want conventional use of
    terms and descriptors. For example, Shiny apps are always described
    as Shiny apps.

\item
  Amanda will talk to Dave Lawrence about using his code to guide R
  development of the \emph{Diversity Report}.
\item
  Mark will complete submission to CRAN for publication to the
  consortium.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Mark expects that the package will be accepted on CRAN once examples
    have been provided for all exported functions. This is not a trivial
    matter as there are currently 142 exported functions.
  \item
    Mark will remove exporting of functions that do not need to be
    exported.
  \item
    Mark will use code from the unit tests for many of the examples.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Mark has completed only the first of the four items from the 20191120
  meeting. These will be addressed after the submission to CRAN is
  successful.

  affect the genetic value analysis.

Ballou \& Lacy describe genome uniqueness as ``the proportion of
simulations in which an individual receives the only copy of a founder
allele.'' We have interpreted this as meaning that genome uniqueness
should only be calculated for living, non-founder animals. Alleles
possessed by living founders are not considered when calculating genome
uniqueness.

We have a differing view on this, since a living founder can still
contribute to the population. The function below calculates genome
uniqueness for all living animals and considers all alleles. It does not
ignore living founders and their alleles.

Our results for genome uniqueness will, therefore differ slightly from
those returned by Pedscope. Pedscope calculates genome uniqueness only
for non-founders and ignores the contribution of any founders in the
population. This will cause Pedscope's genome uniqueness estimates to
possibly be slightly higher for non-founders than what this function
will calculate.

  Amanda provided a new logo to use, which represents all of the
  National Primate Research Centers. This is necessary because the ONPRC
  parent organization does not allow them to have a logo. Mark will
  incorporate that logo into the application and add some comments
  regarding development supported by ONPRC and SNPRC. Added 20190119.
\item
  Discussed harem formation and formation of groups with a set sex

  configuration. The user interface will redraw based on the radio
  button selected to reflect the user interface elements needed within
  the selected workflow. Done 20190224

\item
  Mark reported that he was having trouble implementing the user
  interface elements needed for items 4 and 5 of the 20181105 meeting
  notes. Specifically the need to have dynamically generated text input
  boxes for the number of groups to be formed is the issue. He has not
  figured out either the desired interface behavior or the technical
  methods needed for this feature. This is going to delay getting the
  tutorials written, which he had hoped to complete in first draft form
  during December.
\end{enumerate}

After some discussion, all agreed that the features described in items 4
and 5 are sufficiently important to delay the preparation of the
tutorials and subsequent technical paper a few weeks. Thus, Mark will
work on getting these implemented in December with plans on working on
the tutorials in January.

Ability to form harems. Done 20181230.

Ability to form breeding groups with specified sex ratios. Done
20180103.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Amanda and Mark had fairly extensive discussions regarding how group
  selection is to be done. The current software forms groups so that
  there is no overlap of animals among any of the groups. The plan is
  for Mark to implement a group selection procedure that will make two
  types of groups.
\end{enumerate}

One group type is what is currently done by the software (no overlap of
animals among any of the groups formed.) These groups will be made up of
all of the animals that can be used in groups based on kinship and sex
ratio criteria such that none of the groups have any individuals in
common.

The second type of group is a collection of sub-groups where each
sub-group is a group of the first type. Thus, there is no overlap of
animals within any one sub-group of groups and there is potential
overlay among the various subgroups. This is complected and hard to
follow so it is illustrated with the list below where each letter
represent a specific animal. Overlapping Groups 1-4 have within them
sets of animal that have no animals in common with other unique sets
within the group.

For example, animal \textbf{H} appears in set 1 of each overlapping
group, but it does not appear more than once in any on group. Also,
animal \textbf{E} appears in group 1, 2, and 4 and not in group 3.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Overlapping Group 1 - Unique Set 1: I,B,J,L,H - Unique Set 2:
  D,G,U,S,Q - Unique Set 3: E,P,F,A,C

  Overlapping Group 2 - Unique Set 1: M,V,H,Z,K - Unique Set 2:

\item
  Overlapping Group 3 - Unique Set 1: H,I,F,X,K - Unique Set 2:
  Q,Y,A,D,S - Unique Set 3: T,B,C,G,M
\item

\item
  Mark is to reorganize the \textbf{Input} tab to place the description
  of the minimum parent age in hovertext and make the check pedigree
  button more evident. Done 20181212.

  Check the outliers found in the first box and whisker plot when the

  as described: Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called
  ``outlying'' points and are plotted individually. The jittered points
  are overlaid on top of the boxplot and its outliers. Done 20181112
\item
  Add the ability to select a sex ratio for group formation. Ratios are
  to be female to male starting with 1:1 and progressing by 0.5 on the
  female side, holding the male side at 1. Go up to a ratio of 10:1. The
  progression will look something like 1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 2.5:1 \ldots{}
  10:1.
\item
  Add the ability to use harems with 1 male and any number of females.
  One way to do this would be to put any number of males in with the
  females in the list of candidates and then specify that single male
  harems are to be formed with a specified number of groups formed. This
  will allow the select of the best males to be selected from the excess
  male candidates.
\item
  Beth is to contact Mark at least a week prior to the next meeting to
  set up a time to diagnose why her installation of the software is not
  working. Rcpp package was not being replaced during installation and
  update of other packages. This prevented nprcmanager from being
  installed. Beth manually removed the old version of the Rcpp package,
  installed a newer version and then installed nprcmanager and
  rmsutilityr. Mark will do some research to see if others have reported
  similar problems. Working with Beth prompted the development of a
  function that reports the version of the application on the input tab
  so users can easily find out which version they are using. Done
  20181109.
\item
  Until we work on LabKey connectivity again, we have decided to
  postpone Item 2 from two meetings ago: Give user the option to save a
  skeleton configuration file to their home directory if they do not
  have a configuration file.
\item
  We reaffirmed the plan for Mark to finish the tutorials (one for an
  interactive use of the software and one for using the Shiny
  application) and to get a draft of a technical paper written by the
  end of the year.
\item
  Not discussed during the meeting was the need to develop additional
  unit tests to cover all of the new functions created to handle the
  PEDSYS and military formatted dates (YYYYMMDD), which look like an
  integer. Most of those unit tests have been made, but additional ones
  are needed to provide full or near full coverage. Done 20181112

  Found that breeding groups being formed included unknown animals that

\item
  Worked with Terry Hawkins on 20181119 and 20181120 to make sure the
  LabKey code was working. He had an error in his base URL specification
  so that initial efforts failed and the error message was misleading. I
  have trapped the error with a tryCatch function and am sending a
  message to the log file. This needs to be tested.

\item
  Item 2 from last meeting list: Give user the option to save a skeleton
  configuration file to their home directory if they do not have a

\item
  During the next meeting, we will work with Beth on clearly defining
  how breeding group formation tab should work. In the mean time, Mark
  will examine the current behavior and code so that he understands
  exactly what is being done.
\item
  The near term goal is to produce a technical paper within the next six
  months that describes the software. Mark will get this started by
  completing two tutorial documents. The first will be a tutorial on how
  to use the major functions from the R console in an interactive mode.
  The second will be a tutorial on how to use the Shiny application. The
  first tutorial should be completed some time in December.
\item
  Amanda and Mark discussed the goal of enhancing the scope of software
  to include the ability to do phenotype -- genotype association
  studies. Amanda has some ideas regarding direction. Mark needs some
  guidance as to what techniques to investigate.

  Added the ability to call qcStudbook interactively with a flag

  checking for others. For example, if the birth date column has an
  invalid format, the parental age cannot be checked. If no errors are

  The second bullet point under the Input File Handling section of the
  Input tab says ``Please be aware that animals with no parents will be
  treated as founders in these calculations, i.e., sources of new
  genetic variation in the colony.''
\end{enumerate}

I am assuming that this is fine and stated only to keep users aware that
if they have parental information it has to be entered.

  The third bullet point under the Input File Handling section of the

  Reminder for Mark only: The third bullet point under the Input File
  Handling section of the Input tab says ``If the Age column is
  provided, the program will use the user-specified age.''

Make sure this is true. I may also want to check for internal
inconsistencies.

\item
  In the Input File Handling section of the Input tab the last bullet
  point immediately above the first table says ``Genotype data may be
  supplied within the pedigree file or in a separate genotype file. Only
  two additional columns (first and second) are required when the
  genotypes are provided within the pedigree file.''
\end{enumerate}

This should be explained more fully and the program behavior may need to
be changed. Currently the program assumes the columns first and second
are there and are correctly formed. Currently there is no check to
ensure that first\_name and second\_name data elements are consistent
with first and second data elements.

\begin{enumerate}

  In the Input File Handling section of the Input tab and under the

\end{enumerate}

Should we provide a summary of changes made to the input data such as
changes in column names, sex identifiers, etc., removal of duplicated
rows and columns that are added?

Need name for genotype (first\_name, second\_name) Need new name for
breeders only file type. Reword ``Animals without birth dates are not
considered.'' When minimum parent age is included, animals without birth
dates are not rejected.

Change update breeding colony (pedigree browser) by adding explanatory
text.

\paragraph{20170917}\label{section-36}}

I discovered why the plot of genetic uniqueness scores was not as
expected. It was from an analysis where 0 was the threshold setting,
which I think we should consider removing as an option. I have set the
default to 3, which is what Amanda Vinson's paper indicated that ONPRC
typically used.

I got the logging system integrated into the package. I am using the
package futile.logger (funny name). Note the check box at the bottom of
the side panel on the two attached images. When the Debug on check box
is checked (it is not checked by default), the application writes to a
file in the users home directory named \emph{nprcmanager.log}. Currently
I am only logging events occurring the the \emph{server.R} file, because
that is where I tend to have most of my problems show up. I have
attached an example file in which turned on logging at the debug level
and then read in a couple of pedigree files.

I added code coverage reports to the automated build system running on
Travis-CI.org. Currently we only have 5.68\% of the code being tested
with the unit tests I created thus far. I do not know the code well
enough to know what percentage we will have when I feel comfortable, but
I know most of the functions have no tests at all.

Can now assign known genotypes to individuals and to incorporate that

I have connected the Travis CI (continuous integration) tool to my
github.com/rmsharp/nprcmanager so that when I check in code it
automatically tries to build it from scratch using packages from CRAN.
Travis CI is now automatically building nprcmanager without errors or
warnings. This puts us considerably closer to being able to offer the
package via CRAN if we want.

Jack, Debbie, and Charles,

Thank you for meeting with me. I appreciate your help in clarifying the
various stages of the issues associated with providing genetic
management guidance via simulation with partially known MHC data.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  I will look more closely into what will be needed to add genetic
  information and gene frequency information into the gene dropping
  routines in the kinship2 package. The initial implementation will use
  only a single locus, which should be a sufficient for MHC data

  A. First step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes
  in children of individuals when we provide genetic data to all
  founders using a gene frequency based algorithm.

  B. Second step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes
  in children when all parental generations have fully known genotypes.

  C. Third step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes
  in children when parental generations have partially known genotypes
  and all other genotypes are uninformative.

  D. Fourth step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes
  in children when parental generations have partially known genotypes
  and remaining parental genes are determined by gene frequency.
\item
  We will not worry about getting rid of genes in the pedigrees since
  colony managers need only not breed animals that carry unwanted
  alleles.
\item
  I will produce a small number of pedigree drawings using the data
  Debbie has provided to get feedback on preferences and additional
  requirements.
\item
  I will not deal with paternity and maternity issues within the
  pedigrees at this time.
\end{enumerate}

Thanks again.
