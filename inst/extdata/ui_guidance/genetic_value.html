<p>
	A <em><b>genetic value analysis</b></em> ranks animals according
	to their genetic value to the breeding colony, based on an algorithm
	that incorporates measures of mean kinship to the rest of the colony,
	as well as the probability that an animal contains rare founder alleles
	that should be conserved in the colony.

	For a full description of the algorithm, see the <b>Genetic Value Analysis and Breeding Group Description</b> tab.
