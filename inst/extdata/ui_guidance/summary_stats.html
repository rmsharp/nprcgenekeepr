	<h3><b>Summary Statistics</b></h3>
	After running a Genetic Value Analysis, this page
	will contain summary statistics, histograms, and box plots for
	the population under consideration.
	<br>
	<b>Note:</b> Founder equivalents and founder genome
	equivalents will be inflated due to partial parentage
	information. Calculating these statistics necessitates
	adding placeholder IDs to fill out partial parentage
	information. Each placeholder ID used is treated as
	a founder. Calculations of <em>f<sub>e</sub></em> and
	<em>f<sub>g</sub></em> may be changed at some point
	in the future to try to correct for this situation.
