<h4>Input File Handling:</h4>
<p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px">
		This software requires an input file for each breeding colony to be
		analyzed. Multiple separate pedigrees within the same breeding
		colony can be accommodated within the same input file.
	</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px">
		If an animal is missing information on one parent, that cell
		should be blank. For animals with no information on either parent,
		both cells under "Sire ID" and "Dam ID" should be blank. For animals
		with information on one parent a unique "placeholder" ID
		(designated as UnkownID and UnkID in Pedigree Brower tab) will be assigned by the
		software to represent the unknown parent.  <em>Please be aware that
		animals with no parents will be treated as founders in these
		calculations, i.e., sources of new genetic variation in the colony.</em>
	</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px">
	  Genotypic information for a single locus can be included in the genetic
	  analyses. See <a href="#pedigree_format">Pedigree File Format</a> and
	  <a href="#genotype_format">Genotype File Format</a> below for file
	  descriptions.
	  Observed genotypic information can be supplied for any members of
	  the pedigree. Designation of two alleles is required as currently
	  there is no accommodation for partial genetic information for an individual.
	  Please contact
	  <a href="mailto:rmsharp@me.com?Subject=nprcmanager:%20Need%20to%20allow%20partial%20genetic%20information" target="_top">R. Mark Sharp</a>

<p>The following columns names are reserved and will be recognized:</p>
<p><i>Ego ID, Sire ID, Dam ID,</i> and <i>Sex</i> are required columns.</p>
<p>Either <i>Age</i> or <i>Birth</i> must also be provided.
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px">
		Use the Allowable Names listed in the table below. Allowable Name case and

		each column is the name used internally and is the name used in
		examples and output.

	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px">
		If the <i>Age</i> column is provided, the program will use the
		user-specified age.
	</li>

	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px">
		<i>Exit</i> dates, if provided, will supercede <i>Death</i> and
		<i>Departure</i> dates. If <i>Exit</i> is not provided, <i>Death</i>
		and <i>Departure</i> will be combined based on which date is
		chronologically first. (This functions primarily to catch clerical
		errors or historical changes in record-keeping practices).
	</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 15px">
		Dates should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD (this date option can be
		found under the "English-U.K." locale option under the
		"Format Cells -> Number -> Date" menu in Excel 2010).

	<li>
		Genotype data may be supplied within the pedigree file or in a separate
