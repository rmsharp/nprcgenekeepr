"""methodology_trim.py — the ledger trimmer.

Moves the oldest records out of a grow-and-must-be-read ledger into a frozen shard under
`docs/archive/`, and refuses to do it unless the move is provably lossless.

Implements the ledger-trimmer design (S35). `bin/sync` installs this file at your project root
and does NOT install that design, a working document for the tool's authors rather than something
an adopter operates. It is `docs/planning/ledger-trimmer-design.md` in the rmsharp/methodology
fork, linked here at the commit that last changed it, so the link cannot drift:
https://github.com/rmsharp/methodology/blob/979dc7382702be0963b0534846e3dd23d5b6d4ca/docs/planning/ledger-trimmer-design.md
The design is the spec and this file does not re-open it; whoever changes this module reads its
§2 (the three-zone record model), §4 (the three assertions) and §5 (the trigger) first. Nothing
mechanical protects this reference: `bin/check-links` validates only the distributed *markdown*,
so a dangling citation inside this module is never reported.

WHY THREE ASSERTIONS AND NOT ONE
    The manual procedure this replaces proved whole-file byte identity under concatenation, and
    that proof passed while a paragraph was silently lost (`020ba3f` — the pre-v3.0 scope footer
    of the root CHANGELOG, still missing today). It *had* to pass: moving a paragraph from the
    live file into the shard is exactly byte-preserving under concatenation. So:

      L1  concatenation identity, scoped to the RECORDS zone   — is every record byte still somewhere?
      L2  zone pinning                                          — is every byte still in the RIGHT file?
      L3  record partition, per record, by identity+order+bytes — was it a pure move, or a move plus an edit?

    None of the three is the whole-file check, and that is deliberate: the unscoped whole-file form
    is unsatisfiable on any run that regenerates the pointer (design §4.2).

DEFAULTS THAT ARE INVERTED ON PURPOSE
    Dry run is the default; `--write` is required to touch anything. The tool never commits, and
    it never runs `git mv` (design P2): a trim writes a new shard and edits the live ledger in
    place, so the ledger keeps its path and its history.

Python 3 stdlib only, cross-platform — this file is destined for adopter roots (design §6.1).

# THE AGENT READ CAP, RE-DENOMINATED — Phase B, 2026-08-26. The cap is TOKEN-denominated and
# always was. The 2,000-line proxy that stood here was wrong on the axis, and measured across the
# fleet it was STRICTLY DOMINATED: over 18 watched ledgers in 5 repos it fired on 3 and stayed
# silent on 8 that a byte threshold at ANY point in the measured ratio band catches, while
# catching nothing a byte threshold misses. So the axis choice does not rest on picking the right
# constant. It is NOT published as one opaque number — a number goes stale when the harness moves
# and the command does not — but DERIVED from two inputs that each carry their own re-measurement.
READ_CAP_TOKENS = 25_000       # [M] stated verbatim by the tool itself: "exceeds maximum allowed
                               # tokens (25000)". Harness behaviour, not a repo property.
MIN_BYTES_PER_TOKEN = 2.27     # [M] the FLOOR of the band 2.2705–3.0300 B/token measured over 9
                               # real markdown files in 5 repos. The floor and not the mean,
                               # because a guard that must not stay silent on a truncating file
                               # has to assume the densest content it will meet. Deliberately NOT
                               # context_budget.py's `bytes_per_token`: that is calibrated on
                               # OPENING CONTEXT against CLAUDE.md's size, a different quantity —
                               # and re-running its own --calibrate today returns 2.46 at R² 0.59,

                               # probe shows it comes back whole. Re-derive with Appendix A.
READ_CAP_BYTES = int(READ_CAP_TOKENS * MIN_BYTES_PER_TOKEN)   # 56,750 B — computed, never written
READ_REFUSE_BYTES = 256 * 1024 # [M] a SECOND and HARDER boundary, and it is NOT truncation: past
                               # it a default Read is refused outright with ZERO content —
                               # "File content (256.1KB) exceeds maximum allowed size (256KB)".
                               # So "truncation is ordered top-down, and the prefix a session
                               # needs still arrives" is true only BETWEEN the two boundaries.
                               # Past this one nothing arrives at all, front matter included.
                               # 5 of the 18 watched fleet ledgers are already past it.
# --- Phase C2, 2026-08-26: the CLASS A pair, and the budget moved to meet it ------------------
# WHAT CHANGED AND WHY, stated here because both numbers below are judgment and the next session
# must be able to re-open them on the reasoning rather than on taste.
#
# Phase C1 established that the watched population is TWO CLASSES, and that the class this tool
# can act on -- the names in LEDGERS -- is exactly Class A. For those two files READ_CAP_BYTES is
# the wrong thing to FIRE on. It is a true statement about them ("one Read does not deliver this
# whole file") and it stays in the --check report for that reason, but it is not a fault: these
# ledgers are newest-on-top and delivery is an ORDERED PREFIX, so truncation removes the OLDEST
# records, which is the end nothing was reading. Measured across 85 transcripts of this repo, each
# root ledger was read WHOLE exactly ONCE and in PART 1,696 times. What front matter + the newest
# record costs is 30-32% of one read, with ~40 KB of growth headroom (plan §3).
#
# The failure that DOES matter is READ_REFUSE_BYTES, where the prefix stops existing and a default
# Read returns nothing at all -- front matter included. So the Class A arm is denominated against
# the REFUSAL, not against the cap, and it fires BELOW it rather than at it: a trigger set at the
# refusal parks the file exactly on the edge where degradation stops being graceful (plan §3
# caveat 1). 192 KiB leaves 64 KiB of margin under the refusal; 96 KiB is the stop, which is the
# `level with hysteresis` shape ledger-trimmer-design.md §5.2 prescribes for a threshold sitting at
# operating size, and NOT the rate form that was deleted for being unsatisfiable.
#
# ⚠ SCOPED TO THE REPO ROOT, and this was an operator decision made on a measurement. LEDGERS is
# resolved by BASENAME at any depth (`LEDGERS.get(path.name)`, :1674+), so an unscoped relaxation
# would hand the 192 KiB arm to any */CHANGELOG.md or */HANDOFFS.md -- 3.38x READ_CAP_BYTES -- for
# a file the dashboard never classified as anything (its read_cap_class() is a repo-relative PATH
# lookup and answers None for a nested one). A nested ledger keeps READ_CAP_BYTES. See
# Trigger.class_a and evaluate_trigger.
CLASS_A_FIRE_BYTES = 192 * 1024   # 196,608 — fire above this, for a ROOT Class A ledger only
CLASS_A_STOP_BYTES = 96 * 1024    # 98,304 — cut back to at or under this. Deliberately equal to
                                  # int(DEFAULT_BUDGET_BYTES * BYTE_STOP_FRACTION) today, and
                                  # deliberately NOT written as that expression: the two arms
                                  # answer different questions (see the Trigger comment below) and
                                  # deriving one from the other would assert they are one question.
                                  # The coincidence is asserted by a test as INTENTIONAL, so that
                                  # moving one without the other is a decision and not an accident.

# RAISED 64 KiB -> 192 KiB at Phase C2 (option C1), by operator decision, in the SAME change as the
# Class A arm above because separately each is inert: `fires` is `read_fires or byte_fires`, so a
# relaxed read arm changes nothing while a 64 KiB byte arm fires first (plan §5, §10 dragon 1).
# THE OLD JUSTIFICATION IS RETIRED, NOT CARRIED FORWARD. It read "design §5.4: calibrated to the
# three sizes this repo operated at" -- 52,927 / 53,512 / 49,382 B, the post-archive resets of
# 2026-08. Those are no longer the sizes this repo operates at (81,070 and 111,388 B at this
# commit), and the campaign that measured them adjudicated the growth as costing nothing anyone
# reads. A calibration whose basis has moved is not a baseline; it is a stale number with a
# citation. ⚠ A DERIVATION NOTE THE PLAN GOT WRONG AND A SUCCESSOR SHOULD NOT INHERIT: it is
# widely written that this constant is "the number BL-9/BL-32/BL-36/S87/S89 have all measured
# against". That is impossible for BL-9, which CLOSED 2026-08-01 against a constant first written
# 2026-08-03 (df381ea); §5.4's 52,927 B is BL-9's own output commit 7a71df0, so BL-9 is this
# constant's INPUT. The other four were not re-derived and are claimed neither way.
DEFAULT_BUDGET_BYTES = 192 * 1024  # 196,608 — the per-file byte budget, still overridable
                                   # per LedgerSpec and per run via --budget-bytes

# LINE_FIRE_BELOW / LINE_STOP_ABOVE ARE GONE, DELIBERATELY. This note is the record of why, so a
# later session re-adds them on purpose or not at all. They were "archive when headroom falls
# below 15 RECORDS; cut until it is back above 30" — denominated in records of headroom TO the
# cap. Measured at Phase B: a one-read CHANGELOG.md holds 20.9 records and a one-read HANDOFFS.md
# holds 4.3, so a rule demanding 30 records of headroom is UNSATISFIABLE ON BOTH AT EVERY HONEST
# CAP, and `choose_cut` falls through to `return 1` — retaining ONE record with every test in the
# repo still green. It only ever looked satisfiable because 2,000 lines granted CHANGELOG.md 2.32×
# and HANDOFFS.md 8.75× more capacity than a real read. design §5.2 states the reason itself: the
# units-of-headroom form is well-formed only while the cap "sits far above normal operating size",
# and at operating size that design prescribes "a level with hysteresis, not a rate — the form
# that terminates". `byte_fires` + BYTE_STOP_FRACTION below is already that form, so the read cap
# now takes it too. Re-deriving the two thresholds was considered and rejected on the measurement
# rather than on taste; the arithmetic is in read-cap-premise-correction-plan.md, Phase B.
BYTE_STOP_FRACTION = 0.5       # hysteresis — stops a trim re-firing on the next record
SRF_RED = 1.00                 # plan §3.3 H3: at or above this, a reset is the wrong move
ARCHIVE_DIR = "docs/archive"
REBASE_PREFIX = "../../"       # docs/archive/<shard>.md -> repo root is exactly two levels
SHARD_SUFFIX_MAX = 99          # BL-41 — bound on collision disambiguation; past it, refuse

# --- "is this plausibly a fresh seed?" — a DIFFERENT question from "is it over its budget" ----
# Deliberately its own literal rather than an alias of DEFAULT_BUDGET_BYTES, and deliberately not
# `opts.budget_bytes`: --budget-bytes tunes when a trim FIRES, and the seeds invite an adopter to
# lower it. Wiring that knob into this test would let a calibration choice decide whether the tool
# tells you your ledger grammar is wrong — and a budget set below 12,124 B would declare the seed
# we ship to be unreadable. The two numbers may drift apart; nothing should couple them.
SEED_PLAUSIBLE_MAX_BYTES = 64 * 1024
SEED_PLAUSIBLE_MAX_LINES = 2000
# ^ THE VALUE IS UNCHANGED AND THE NAME IS NEW, and that is the whole point (Phase B, J3). This
# line count used to be READ_CAP_LINES, borrowed. But the question here is not "does one Read
# deliver this file?" — it is "is a file THIS LONG plausibly a fresh, empty seed, or is my grammar
# wrong?" Nothing about truncation bears on it. Sharing the name meant a correction made for the
# reporter's reasons would silently move the REFUSAL boundary: at a corrected cap, a record-less
# file of 700–2,000 lines would newly refuse with GRAMMAR_MISMATCH instead of reporting NO_RECORDS,
# and no test in this repo would have caught it. The byte disjunct beside it already covers "big
# file"; this one uniquely covers LONG BUT SMALL — say 3,000 lines averaging 20 B. Re-tune it, if
# ever, on seed plausibility and on nothing else.

# The trigger — two metrics, because there are two distinct failure modes. BOTH ARE NOW LEVELS
# WITH HYSTERESIS on the same axis (bytes), and that is the Phase B change: what used to be a
# line-denominated RATE is now a byte-denominated LEVEL.
#
#   READ DELIVERY — does one `Read` still return this file? The cap is TOKEN-denominated
#   (~25,000), truncation is ANNOUNCED rather than silent, and there is a SECOND boundary at
#   256 KiB past which a default read is REFUSED with zero content. READ_CAP_BYTES converts the
#   token cap at the densest content measured, so the guard is conservative by construction.
#   Re-measure with Appendix A of docs/planning/read-cap-premise-correction-plan.md; nothing in
#   this repo can falsify it, because nothing here can invoke the agent's Read tool.
#
#   AND THE METRIC MEASURES A CONDITION IT MAY NOT REMEDY (BL-52, open, and Phase B did not close
#   it). Truncation is ordered top-down and these ledgers are newest-on-top, so between the two
#   boundaries the records a cut removes are ones a whole-file read was NOT DELIVERING ANYWAY:
#   the delivered prefix is the same before and after, and what changes is that the reader stops
#   being WARNED. Two things narrow that caveat rather than dissolve it. Past READ_REFUSE_BYTES
#   there IS no delivered prefix, so a cut back under it turns nothing into something. And below
#   the cap the whole file is delivered and every byte is paid for, so a cut moves a file from
#   truncated to fully delivered. The caveat bites hardest well past the cap and not at all near
#   it. Do not read this metric as a settled argument for cutting; do not read it as no argument.
#
#   CONTEXT TAX — G1, the operator's stated goal. Bytes, against a per-file budget. A separate
#   claim, not covered by the caveat above, and untouched by Phase B.
#
# The two are deliberately NOT deduplicated here even though they now share an axis: they answer
# different questions and their thresholds have unrelated provenance. Whether the dashboard should
# still report them as two rows is S38's residual 1, still open (Phase C).

        ⚠ WHICH ARM BINDS MOVED AT PHASE C2, and the direction is worth stating. At the old budget
        `byte_ok` was the tighter of the two (32,768 B against READ_CAP_BYTES' 56,750). At the

        says. That is the conservative direction, and it is the reason `class_a` defaults False.

# Self-contained and FROZEN: it embeds the record grammar it was written against, so a later change
# to the trimmer cannot silently change what this shard's proof means. Re-derives L1 (records-zone
# concatenation), L2 (zone pinning) and L3 (record partition). Exits non-zero on failure.
# Run it; do not trust a digest. The last hand-published digest for this repo is not reproducible
# from the artifacts it describes, which is the whole reason this file exists.
#
# NOTE: file contents are read by python, never through $(...) — command substitution strips
# trailing newlines, which silently truncates the LAST record and fails L1/L3 on a correct trim.
# That is not hypothetical: it is what the first version of this script did.

# --- What the TRIM COMMIT introduced, MEASURED rather than assumed (BL-36) -------------------
#
# This script re-derives from git at commit granularity, and a commit may legitimately carry more
# than the trim: this repository's own close-out practice writes the trim's ledger entry, that
# session's other entries, and the archive move in one commit. Those extra records are new
# content. They were never in `before`, so they make no claim whatsoever about whether an
# archived record survived — and they must not be able to fail a losslessness proof.
#
# The shipped versions of this script skipped them POSITIONALLY, via a constant `INJECTED` baked
# in at generation time as `1 if trims_the_ledger else 0`. That is a 0/1 flag, not a count: it is
# structurally incapable of modelling a commit that lands two records instead of one, so every
# bundled trim failed by construction with zero data loss. Four of this repo's six shipped proofs
# failed exactly that way while an independent identity-keyed re-derivation measured 0 records
# missing at every trim (docs/audits/2026-08-15-bl36-archive-losslessness.md).
#
# So the injected set is measured HERE, from record content: the records present in
# `after + shard` and absent from `before`. This is a different function of the same three
# artifacts — never the difference L1/L3 are about to assert on — so it cannot make those
# assertions vacuous: delete an archived record and it is missing from `have` no matter what else
# the commit added. Occurrences are removed one-for-one, preserving order, so L1 still compares
# bytes in sequence and a REORDER is still a failure.
#
# It deliberately does NOT excuse a record EDITED inside the trim commit. Such a record's
# pre-trim bytes exist nowhere afterwards; it is reported as MISSING and the proof stays red,
# which is BL-27's judgement and is still correct — a real loss has that same shape.
# NAMES: `absent_records` / `added_records`, not the obvious `missing` / `added`. This is a flat
# script -- every binding here is a module global -- and L2's front-matter clause below already
# binds `missing` for its own, unrelated meaning (front-matter LINES that vanished). Calling this
# one `missing` silently rebinds it before L3 reads it, and because L2 usually finds nothing the
# rebind is to [], so L3 skips its own clause and reports a downstream symptom instead. That is
# not hypothetical: it is what the first build of this fix did, and the narrowed loss control
# caught it. Anything added here needs the same namespace check.

# Design §6.3's exit table already said `3 | usage error: ... no records`, and this branch shipped
# with no exit code at all. Restoring 3 for the unreadable half is a return to the ratified table.
# KEEPING 0 FOR THE GENUINELY-EMPTY HALF IS ADDED POLICY, labelled here as such: a day-one adopter
# running --check from a hook must not be handed a usage error for a correctly-seeded file, and the
# design's own edge-case list ("zero archivable records → 0 with a stated reason") shows the family
# it belongs to. ZONE_UNCLASSIFIED is the model the refusal copies — refuse, name the evidence,
# print the offending span, and do not guess.
