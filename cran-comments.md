## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Responded to both requests provided by the reviewer
  - I have removed the capitalization from "Genetic Tools for Colony 
    Management" and "Genetic Value Analysis Reports" within DESCRIPTION.
  - I have removed the conditional installation of DT from the ui.R file.
* I have incremented the version from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3, updated NEWS to reflect
  the changes, and updated all documentation to reflect the version change.
