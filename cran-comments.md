## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Responded to each request provided by the reviewer
  - Request: please write 'Shiny' as 'shiny', as package names are 
    case-sensitive.
    -   I have not changed the capitalization of `Shiny` in the description 
        section of the DESCRIPTION file as it is the name of the type of 
        application and is not being used as the name of the package. The use
        of the capitalization is consistent with the capitalization used within
        the documentation for the `shiny` package (?shiny, See the Details 
        section, first sentence where it is used as the type of tutorial.) 
        and all documentation and tutorials provided by the author and RStudio
        where it is capitalized everywhere except when referring to the package.
  - Request: It seems like you have too many spaces in your description field. 
    Probably because linebreaks count as spaces too. Please remove unecassary 
    ones.
    -  I have removed the extra spaces from the description field in the 
       DESCRIPTION file, which occurred at the end of some of the lines. The 
       remaining occurrences of multiple consecutive spaces are at the
       beginning of lines, which are required for their mandatory indentation.
  - Request: Please add \value to .Rd files regarding exported methods and
    explain the functions results in the documentation. Please write about the
    structure of the output (class) and also what the output means. (If a
    function does not return a value, please document that too, e.g.,
    \value{No return value, called for side effects} or similar).
    -  I have provided \value elements to all functions except the following,
       which are documentation elements:
       - data.R
       - nprcgenekeeper.R
       - nprcgenekeepr-package.R
  - Request: Please unwrap the examples if they are executable in < 5 sec, or
    replace dontrun{} with \donttest{}.
    \dontrun{} should only be used if the example really cannot be executed
    (e.g. because of missing additional software, missing API keys, ...) by the
    user. That's why wrapping examples in \dontrun{} adds the comment 
    ("# Not run:") as a warning for the user. Does not seem necessary. 
    Please replace \dontrun with \donttest.
    -   I have removed all instances of \dontrun
    
  - Request: Please do not set a seed to a specific number within a function.
    For more details: <https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/code_issues.html#setting-a-specific-seed>
    -  I have not made any changes based on this request as I have restricted 
       the use of setting a seed to those situations where each function's 
       purpose is to dynamically create a data set for instructional or unit 
       testing purposes. In both cases, producing identical results each time
       is critical to the purpose of the function.



* I have incremented the version from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7, updated NEWS to reflect
  the changes, and updated all documentation to reflect the version change.
