\title{Makes a list object containing kinship summary statistics using the list
object from \strong{createSimKinships}.}
\usage{
cumulateSimKinships(ped, allSimParents, pop = NULL, n = 10L)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{The pedigree information in data.frame format}

\item{allSimParents}{list made up of lists where the internal list
has the offspring ID \code{id}, a vector of representative sires
(\code{sires}), and a vector of representative dams(\code{dams}).}

\item{pop}{Character vector with animal IDs to consider as the population of
interest. The default is NULL.}

\item{n}{integer value of the number of simulated pedigrees to generate.}
}
\value{
List object containing the meanKinship, sdKinship, minKinship, and
maxKinship.
}
\description{
\code{cumulateSimKinships} creates a named
list of length 4 is generated where the first element is the mean of the
simulated kinships, the second element is the standard deviation of the
simulated kinships the third element is the minimum value of the kinships,
and the forth element is the maximum value of the kinships.
