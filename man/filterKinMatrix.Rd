\title{Filters a kinship matrix to include only the egos listed in 'ids'}
\usage{
filterKinMatrix(ids, kmat)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{character vector containing the IDs of interest.
The kinship matrix should be reduced to only include these rows and columns.}

\item{kmat}{a numeric matrix of pairwise kinship coefficients.
Rows and columns should be named with IDs.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix that is the reduced kinship matrix with named
rows and columns (row and col names are 'ids').
}
