\description{
Primary Data Structure --- Pedigree

Contains studbook information for a number of individuals.
ASSUME: All IDs listed in the sire or dam columns must have a row entry in
the id column

Provides genetic tools for colony management and is a derivation of the work in Amanda Vinson and Michael J Raboin (2015) \url{https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4671785/} "A Practical Approach for Designing Breeding Groups to Maximize Genetic Diversity in a Large Colony of Captive Rhesus Macaques ('Macaca' 'mulatto')". It provides a 'Shiny' application with an exposed API. The application supports five groups of functions: (1) Quality control of studbooks contained in text files or 'Excel' workbooks and of pedigrees within 'LabKey' Electronic Health Records (EHR); (2) Creation of pedigrees from a list of animals using the 'LabKey' EHR integration; (3) Creation and display of an age by sex pyramid plot of the living animals within the designated pedigree; (4) Generation of genetic value analysis reports; and (5) Creation of potential breeding groups with and without proscribed sex ratios and defined maximum kinships.

\code{\link{getIncludeColumns}} to get set of columns that can
be used in a pedigree file

A Pedigree is a data frame within the \code{R} environment with the following
possible columns:
\itemize{
\item\{id\} \{-- character vector with unique identifier for an individual\}
\item\{sire\} \{-- character vector with unique identifier for an
individual's father (\code{NA} if unknown).\}
\item\{dam\} \{-- character vector with unique identifier for an
individual's mother (\code{NA} if unknown).\}
\item\{sex\} \{-- factor \{levels: "M", "F", "U"\} Sex specifier for an
individual\}
\item\{gen\} \{-- integer vector with the generation number of the
individual\}
\item\{birth\} \{-- Date or \code{NA} (optional) with the individual's birth
date\}
\item\{exit\} \{-- Date or \code{NA} (optional) with the individual's exit
date (death, or departure if applicable)\}
\item\{ancestry\} \{-- character vector or \code{NA} (optional) that
indicates the geographic population to which the individual belongs.\}
\item\{age\} \{-- numeric or \code{NA} (optional) indicating the individual's
current age or age at exit.\}
\item\{population\} \{-- logical (optional)
Is the id part of the extant population?\}
\item\{origin\} \{-- character vector or \code{NA} (optional) that indicates
the name of the facility that the individual was imported from if other than
local.\code{NA} indicates the individual was not imported.\}
}

Pedigree File Testing Functions

standardized names.\}
\item\{\link{checkRequiredCols}\} \{--- Examines column names, cols, to see
if all required column names are present.\}
\item\{\link{correctParentSex}\} \{--- Sets sex for animals listed as either
a sire or dam.\}
\item\{\link{getDateErrorsAndConvertDatesInPed}\} \{--- Converts columns of
dates in text form to \code{Date} object columns\}
\item\{\link{checkParentAge}\} \{--- Check parent ages to be at least
\code{minParentAge}\}

pedigree\}
}
Gene Dropping Function

\itemize{
\item\{\link{geneDrop}\} \{--- Performs a gene drop simulation based on the
provided pedigree information\}
}
Genetic Value Analysis Functions

Contains functions to calculate the kinship coefficient and genome
uniqueness for animals listed in a Pedigree table.
\itemize{
\item\{\link{meanKinship}\} \{--- Calculates the mean kinship for each animal
in a kinship matrix\}
\item\{\link{calcA}\} \{--- Calculates \code{a}, the number of an
individual's alleles that are rare in each simulation.\}
\item\{\link{alleleFreq}\} \{--- Calculates the count of each allele in the
provided vector.\}
\item\{\link{calcFE}\} \{--- Calculates founder equivalents.\}
\item\{\link{calcFG}\} \{--- Calculates founder genome equivalents.\}
\item\{\link{calcFEFG}\} \{--- Returns founder equivalents \code{FE} and
\code{FG} as elements in a list.\}
\item\{\link{calcGU}\} \{--- Calculates genome uniqueness for each ID that is
part of the population.\}
\item\{\link{geneDrop}\} \{--- Performs a gene drop simulation based on the
pedigree information.\}
\item\{\link{chooseAlleles}\} \{--- Combines two vectors of alleles by
randomly selecting one allele or the other at each position.\}
\item\{\link{calcRetention}\} \{--- Calculates allelic retention.\}
\item\{\link{filterKinMatrix}\} \{--- Filters a kinship matrix to include
only the egos listed in 'ids'\}
\item\{\link{kinship}\} \{--- Generates a kinship matrix\}
\item\{\link{reportGV}\} \{--- Generates a genetic value report for a provided
pedigree.\}
