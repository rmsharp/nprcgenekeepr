\item{minAge}{integer value indicating the minimum age to consider in group
formation. Pairwise kinships involving an animal of this age or younger will
be ignored. Default is 1 year.}

\item{numGp}{integer value indicating the number of groups that should be
formed from the list of IDs. Default is 1.}

\item{sexRatio}{numeric value indicating the ratio of females to males x
