\title{Calculates Founder Equivalents and Founder Genome Equivalents}
\usage{
calcFEFG(ped, alleles)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{the pedigree information in datatable format.  Pedigree
(req. fields: id, sire, dam, gen, population).

It is assumed that the pedigree has no partial parentage}

\item{alleles}{dataframe contains an \code{AlleleTable}. This is a
table of allele information produced by \code{geneDrop()}.}
}
\value{
The list containing the founder equivalents,
\code{FE = 1 / sum(p ^ 2)}, and the founder genome equivalents,
\code{FG = 1 / sum( (p ^ 2) / r} where \code{p} is average number of
descendants and \code{r} is the mean number of founder alleles retained
in the gene dropping experiment.
