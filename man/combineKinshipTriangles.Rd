\title{Makes a list object of matrices made up of upper and lower triangles a list
of kinship matraces.}
\usage{
combineKinshipTriangles(simKinships)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{The pedigree information in data.frame format}

\item{allSimParents}{list made up of lists where the internal list
has the offspring ID \code{id}, a vector of representative sires
(\code{sires}), and a vector of representative dams(\code{dams}).}

\item{pop}{Character vector with animal IDs to consider as the population of
interest. The default is NULL.}

\item{n}{integer value of the number of simulated pedigrees to generate.}
}
\value{
one matrix for each pair of input matracies with the upper triangle
coming from the upper triangle and the diagnal of the odd matrix and
the lower triangle coming from the even matrix.
}
