\title{Find loops in a pedigree tree}
\usage{
findLoops(ptree)
}
\arguments{
\item{ptree}{a list of lists forming a pedigree tree as constructed by
\code{createPedTree(ped)} where \code{ped} is a standard pedigree dataframe.}
}
\value{
A named list of logical values where each named element is
named with an \code{id} from \code{ptree}. The value of the list element
is set to \code{TRUE} if the \code{id} has a loop in the pedigree.
Loops occur when an animal's sire and dam have a common ancestor.

Part of Pedigree Sampling

}
\details{
Contains functions to build pedigrees from sub-samples
of genotyped individuals.

The goal of sampling is to reduce the number of inbreeding
loops in the resulting pedigree, and thus, reduce the
amount of time required to perform calculations with
SIMWALK2 or similar programs.
